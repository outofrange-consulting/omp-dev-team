# Domain Review

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=clean model, warn=minor issues, fail=boundary violations
Severity: error=violation that causes data exposure, cross-context coupling, or untestable code; warning=misplaced logic or missing abstraction that adds friction; suggestion=modeling improvement with no immediate harm
Confidence: high=mechanical (add missing DTO, rename to domain term); medium=direction clear, entity/service split may have tradeoffs; none=requires human judgment (aggregate boundary decisions, bounded context design)

Model tier: frontier
Context needs: project-structure

## Knowledge Files

Read `dev-team-knowledge/domain-modeling.md` before starting analysis. Whole-file load: the agent uses every section — exploration patterns, anti-pattern recognition, ubiquitous-language drift detection, and the per-language ORM / boundary / application-service signals.

## Explore

Follow the exploration patterns in `dev-team-knowledge/domain-modeling.md#exploration-patterns` to
map the project structure: entity/model files, service layer,
repositories, DTOs, ORM markers, boundary entry points, and
application services.

If none of these patterns yield files, return skip.

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No domain model to analyze"}` when:

- Target is infrastructure-only code (CI/CD, build scripts, configs)
- No business logic or domain entities present

## Detect

Business logic placement:

- Business rules in UI/controller layer (route handlers computing discounts, validation, authorization)
- Business rules in repository or data-access layer
- Application services containing business rules — application services should orchestrate domain objects and infrastructure, not own rules; flag business logic that belongs on an entity or domain service
- Note: domain services legitimately own business rules that don't belong to a single entity — do not flag these

Abstraction leaks:

- Domain objects exposing implementation details
- Technical concerns in domain model
- Infrastructure code (DB, HTTP) mixed with domain

Entity/DTO confusion:

- Missing DTOs for cross-boundary transfer
- Domain objects used for data transfer

Boundary violations:

- Aggregate boundaries not respected
- Direct cross-context dependencies
- Missing domain events for cross-boundary communication

Ubiquitous language:

- Inconsistent terminology within the codebase for the same concept (e.g., `Order` in one module, `Purchase` in another, `Transaction` in a third with no clear distinction)
- Generic names that obscure intent (`process`, `handle`, `data`, `info`, `manager`) where a domain term would be more precise

Note: do not flag terminology as wrong based on assumed business language — only flag internal inconsistency that is observable in the code.

Anemic domain model:

- Entities or aggregates that are pure data holders (only getters/setters, no behavior) while all logic lives in services — suggest moving invariant enforcement and state transitions onto the entity
- Entities that allow external callers to set internal state directly instead of through intention-revealing methods (e.g., setting a status field directly rather than calling a method like `markPaid()` or `Submit()`)

## Skills

Whole-file load: each linked skill is loaded in full when invoked.

- [Ubiquitous Language](the /dev-team:domain-driven-design skill) — invoke when the user asks to "build the glossary", "extract domain terms", or "document the ubiquitous language". Also invoke when domain-review findings show pervasive terminology inconsistency (3+ different names for the same concept across the codebase).

## Output discipline

Derive `status` from the highest-severity finding, never from volume (`dev-team-knowledge/review-output-discipline.md#deterministic-status`), and group same-kind findings — enumerate → classify → group — into ~3–5 concept-level findings per file, keeping `error` findings individual (`dev-team-knowledge/review-output-discipline.md#finding-grouping`).

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the adversarial challenge pass from `dev-team-knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md#domain-review` (domain-review challenge questions). Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.

## Ignore

Code structure, naming style, tests (handled by other agents)
