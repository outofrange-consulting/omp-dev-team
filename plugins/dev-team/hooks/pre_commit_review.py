"""pre_commit_review — Claude Code PreToolUse:Bash hook (Python port).

Python port of hooks/pre-commit-review.sh (#583 / #572 Cluster B).
Extended under #709 to require and durably log a reason when the
`--no-verify`/`-n` bypass is used, closing the frictionless-bypass gap
identified by the gate-correlation evidence (bypassed commits correlate
with materially higher rework).

Blocks `git commit` (exit 2) unless a `.review-passed` file exists in
cwd with a hash matching the currently staged content. The /code-review
command auto-scopes to uncommitted changes and writes this file when
review passes.

Non-commit Bash commands pass through immediately (exit 0).
`git commit --no-verify` (or bare `-n`) is still allowed through — but
only when the process environment carries a non-empty `GATE_BYPASS_REASON`.
When present, the bypass is appended as one line to
`.claude/metrics/gate-bypass-audit.jsonl` (unconditional — not gated by
`DEV_TEAM_TELEMETRY`) and the commit proceeds. When absent, the commit is
blocked with a message naming `GATE_BYPASS_REASON` as the required
mechanism.

Contract (docs/python-hook-contract.md):
    Input : JSON on stdin (Claude Code PreToolUse:Bash payload)
    Exit 0: allow the tool call
    Exit 2: block the tool call (feedback returned to Claude on stdout,
            mirrored to stderr — some hook-error wrappers only surface
            stderr, and a stdout-only block message was going unseen)

Stdlib-only. Python 3.8+.
