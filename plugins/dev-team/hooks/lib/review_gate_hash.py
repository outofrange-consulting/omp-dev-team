"""review_gate_hash — single source of truth for the .review-passed gate hash.

Python port of hooks/lib/review-gate-hash.sh (#576 / #572 Cluster B, #193).

The review gate binds to the STAGED CONTENT (the cached patch), not just
the staged file PATHS. Hashing paths alone let a reviewed file's content
change and still commit unreviewed. Hashing `git diff --cached` captures
both which files are staged AND their staged content — so any edit after
review invalidates the gate and forces a re-review.

Both the writer (`/code-review` step 9) and the reader (pre_commit_review)
MUST compute the hash identically. This module IS that shared computation.

Stdlib-only. Python 3.8+. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.

Byte-parity note: `git diff --cached --no-color` is invariant across bash
and Python callers because git itself owns the format. sha256 hex-encoded
matches the `shasum -a 256 | cut -d' ' -f1` pipeline the .sh uses.
