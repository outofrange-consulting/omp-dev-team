"""token_efficiency_limits — shared thresholds for token-efficiency checks.

Single source of truth for the limits enforced by both
`hooks/token_efficiency_review.py` (the shipped PostToolUse hook) and
`scripts/token_efficiency_review.py` (the repo-root CI runner). Both
previously hardcoded their own copy of these numbers.

Stdlib-only. Python 3.8+. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.
