"""knowledge_index_paths — single source of truth for the indexed corpus.

Python port of hooks/lib/knowledge-index-paths.sh (#575 / #572 Cluster A).

Imported (not executed) by the Python siblings of the three .sh callers:
  - hooks/knowledge-index.py                   (PostToolUse regenerator)
  - hooks/pre-commit-knowledge-index.py        (pre-commit freshness gate)
  - tests/agents/… anchor-citation gate        (still bats today; the .py
                                                port will import this module)

The corpus is:
  - plugins/dev-team/knowledge/*.md         (top-level .md only)
  - plugins/dev-team/skills/<name>/SKILL.md

Excluded:
  - plugins/dev-team/knowledge/schemas/**   (json schemas, not docs)
  - everything else (agents/, commands/, docs/, README.md, …)

Anchor: top-level knowledge .md OR <skills-dir>/<one segment>/SKILL.md.
A leading `(^|/)` allows repo-relative or absolute paths.

Stdlib-only. Python 3.8+. See docs/python-hook-contract.md.
