"""Structural guard: scripts referenced by skills, agents, and hooks must exist.

This is the coverage gap that let #1078 ship — `skills/version/SKILL.md`
invoked `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/lib/plugin_version.py`, a file that did not
exist, and nothing in the suite noticed because skills are agent-followed prose
that CI never executes and no unit test referenced the missing file.

Two high-signal, low-false-positive checks:

1. Every ``$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT``-relative ``.py``/``.sh`` reference in any
   SKILL.md or agent .md resolves to a real file (those paths unambiguously
   point at plugin-internal files, unlike bare example commands that may target
   the user's own project).
2. Every script path in a ``settings.json`` hook command exists.
