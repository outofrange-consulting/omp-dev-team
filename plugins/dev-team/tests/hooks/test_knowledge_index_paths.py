"""Unit tests for hooks/lib/knowledge_index_paths.py (#575 / #572 Cluster A).

Behavior parity with the .sh sibling at hooks/lib/knowledge-index-paths.sh
is what this port owes; the tests below mirror the shape of the existing
bats suite (tests/hooks/knowledge_index_paths_tests.bats) one-for-one so a
future author reading either can trust they agree.
