# Svelte Review

Scope: Svelte files only (`.svelte`, `.svelte.ts`, `.svelte.js`).
Skip this agent entirely if the project has no Svelte files.
Covers both Svelte 4 ($:, stores) and Svelte 5 ($state, $derived, $effect).

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=no reactivity issues, warn=potential concerns, fail=likely silent reactivity breakage
Severity: error=silent reactivity breakage, warning=potential reactivity concern, suggestion=defensive improvement
Confidence: high=mechanical Svelte fix (wrap in $state, add unsubscribe, change to $derived); medium=reactivity pattern identified but component design may affect the fix; none=requires human judgment (state architecture decisions)

Model tier: mid
Context needs: full-file

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No Svelte files in target"}` when:

- No `.svelte`, `.svelte.ts`, or `.svelte.js` files exist in the target
- All target files are non-Svelte

## Detect

Closure state leaks:

- Factory functions returning objects backed by closure variables Svelte can't observe
- Closures holding mutable state that bypasses reactive tracking
- Plain objects constructed outside `$state` used as component state

Mutable reference returns:

- Getters returning internal array/object references instead of copies
- Functions exposing internal mutable state that callers may mutate without triggering reactivity
- Suggest returning `[...arr]`, `{...obj}`, or `structuredClone()` for defensive copies

$state proxy pitfalls (Svelte 5):

- Assigning non-reactive (pre-existing plain) objects into `$state` and expecting deep tracking
- Deep mutation on `$state` objects without reassignment (e.g., `state.nested.arr.push()`)
- Destructuring `$state` into local variables (breaks proxy tracking)
- Spreading `$state` objects into plain objects (loses reactivity)

Missing $derived (Svelte 5):

- Computed values recalculated in `$effect` that should use `$derived`
- Reactive values derived from other reactive values without `$derived`

Store subscription leaks (Svelte 4):

- Manual `.subscribe()` calls without corresponding `unsubscribe` in `onDestroy`
- Subscriptions in non-component contexts without cleanup
- Exception: `$store` auto-subscription syntax is safe

$effect pitfalls (Svelte 5):

- `$effect` that writes to its own dependencies (infinite loop risk)
- Missing reactive dependencies read outside the `$effect` body
- Side effects inside `$derived` (should use `$effect` instead)
- `$effect` used for synchronous derived state (should use `$derived`)

Reactive declaration issues (Svelte 4):

- `$:` blocks with hidden dependencies (reading variables not visible in the statement)
- `$:` blocks with mutation side effects on non-declared variables
- `$:` depending on mutable object references that don't change identity

Lifecycle issues:

- DOM access (querySelector, bindings) before `onMount` / outside `$effect`
- Missing cleanup in `onDestroy` / `$effect` return for timers, listeners, observers
- Accessing `$state` during SSR when it requires browser APIs

## Ignore

Generic array mutation style (handled by js-fp-review), race conditions in non-reactive paths (handled by concurrency-review), accessibility (handled by a11y-review), code structure, naming, domain modeling, security, complexity (handled by other agents)

## Output discipline

Derive `status` from the highest-severity finding, never from volume (`skill://dev-team-knowledge/review-output-discipline.md#deterministic-status`), and group same-kind findings — enumerate → classify → group — into ~3–5 concept-level findings per file, keeping `error` findings individual (`skill://dev-team-knowledge/review-output-discipline.md#finding-grouping`).

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the adversarial challenge pass from `skill://dev-team-knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md#svelte-review` (the shared challenger loop + the svelte-review challenge questions; ≤3 rounds). Append a confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.
