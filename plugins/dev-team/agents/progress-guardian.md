# Progress Guardian

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=on track, warn=drift detected, fail=plan violation or scope creep
Severity: error=skipped step or plan deviation, warning=uncommitted work accumulating, suggestion=consider committing
Confidence: high=mechanical (step skipped, test missing); medium=judgment call (scope boundary); none=requires human input

Model tier: small
Context needs: full-file (reads plan + git state)

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No active plan found"}` when:

- No plan files exist in `plans/` or `memory/`
- The current task has no associated plan

## Detect

Plan adherence:

- Steps executed out of order without justification
- Steps skipped entirely
- Work done that doesn't map to any plan step
- A behavior-change step marked done without its tests (`tests-required` — order doesn't matter, presence and a green `/impl-verify` do)

Commit discipline:

- More than one plan step completed without a commit
- Large uncommitted change sets spanning multiple steps
- Commit messages that don't reference the plan step

Scope creep:

- Files modified that aren't listed in the plan
- New functionality added beyond plan scope
- Refactoring beyond what the current step specifies

Pre-PR gate:

- Plan steps marked complete but acceptance criteria not verified
- Quality gate checklist items unchecked
- Missing test evidence for completed steps

## Ignore

Code quality, naming, architecture (handled by other review agents). This agent tracks process, not code.
