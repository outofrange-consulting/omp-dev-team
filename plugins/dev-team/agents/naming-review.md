# Naming Review

Scope: always
Cites:

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status (derive from the highest-severity finding, do not let finding *volume* alone change the tier): `fail` when any finding is `error` (misleading name) or `warning` (unclear name, magic value, or inconsistent naming) — both harm readability; `warn` when the only findings are `suggestion` (style); `pass` when there are no findings.
Severity: error=misleading names, warning=unclear, suggestion=style
Confidence: high=mechanical (add is/has prefix, extract magic value to constant); medium=better name suggested but domain context may differ; none=requires human judgment (domain terminology choices)

Context needs: diff-only

## Knowledge Files

Read the "Naming Offender Catalog" section of `skill://dev-team-knowledge/design-smells.md#naming-offender-catalog` before analysis. It contains: abbreviation anti-patterns with fix pairs, generic verb offenders, misleading name patterns, and type-encoded name examples — as well as the "What NOT to flag" list to avoid false positives.

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No code files with nameable symbols"}` when:

- Target contains only binary files, images, or generated code
- No files with variable/function/class declarations

## Protocol

Run in three phases — enumerate first, classify second, group third. This prevents selective attention (stopping after the first issue), anchors findings to concrete identifiers before applying judgment, and keeps the finding count proportional to the number of distinct problems rather than the number of lines.

**Phase 1 — Enumerate**: List every identifier visible in the diff:

- Function and method names
- Parameter names
- Variable and constant names (including loop variables)
- Class, interface, and type names
- Enum members and object keys

**Phase 2 — Classify**: For each listed identifier, apply the Detect rules below. Assign severity if flagged.

**Phase 3 — Group**: Report at the granularity of distinct problems, not one finding per identifier — aim for a handful of findings per file. When several identifiers share one mechanical smell, emit a single finding that enumerates the instances in `message`:

- Magic numbers/strings → one finding per coherent value cluster (e.g. the byte-size constants together; the late-fee constants together; the status-code strings together) — typically 3–5 findings, never one-per-literal and never all-literals-as-one.
- Non-standard abbreviations → one finding listing the abbreviations.
- Booleans missing an is/has prefix → one finding listing them.
- A concept named inconsistently across declarations → one finding per concept.

Distinct misleading-name (`error`) findings are always reported individually — never folded into a group.

## Severity Anchors

Calibrate against these worked examples before flagging real code:

| Severity | Identifier | Violation | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `error` | `function data(items)` | Noun used as function name; callers expect a verb | `sumPrices`, `calculateTotal` |
| `error` | `const active = users.filter(u => !u.active)` | Name signals the opposite of the value it holds | `const inactiveUsers` |
| `warning` | `function processItems(list, flag)` | `flag: boolean` reveals nothing about its purpose | `includeZeroPriced: boolean` |
| `warning` | `const cfg = loadConfig()` | Non-standard abbreviation with no precedent in this file | `const config` |
| `suggestion` | `const val = formatPrice(item)` | Generic placeholder-style name | `const formattedPrice` |
| `suggestion` | `const data2 = [...data]` | Sequential suffix where a concept name fits | `const deduplicated` |

## Detect

Intent:

- Variables not revealing contents/purpose
- Functions not describing action
- Parameters not indicating expected values

Conventions:

- Booleans missing is/has/can/should prefix
- Collections not pluralized
- Unnecessary prefixes/suffixes (dataList, strName)

Magic values:

- Hardcoded numbers without named constants
- Hardcoded strings without constants/enums

Consistency:

- Same concept named differently across declarations — call this out as **inconsistent naming** in the finding `message`, and list the variant names
- Non-standard abbreviations

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in `skill://dev-team-knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work these naming-review-specific challenges:

- Did you complete Phase 1 enumeration for EVERY identifier in the diff before classifying, or skip to the obvious offenders?
- For each misleading-name (error) finding, did you confirm the name signals the opposite of its value/behavior, with the code quoted?
- For each magic-value finding, did you verify there is no existing named constant for it already?
- Did you mark domain terminology you can't verify as confidence `none` rather than imposing a generic rename?
- Are there inconsistent names for the same concept across files that you missed by reviewing files in isolation?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.
