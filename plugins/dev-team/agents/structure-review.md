# Structure Review

Scope: always
Cites:
- design-smells
- object-calisthenics

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=clean, warn=minor issues, fail=architectural problems
Severity: error=breaks maintainability, warning=tech debt, suggestion=improvement
Confidence: high=mechanical extraction (duplicate block → shared function); medium=SRP split direction clear but interface design may vary; none=requires human judgment (module boundary decisions, coupling tradeoffs)

Context needs: full-file

## Knowledge Files

Read `skill://dev-team-knowledge/design-smells.md` and `skill://dev-team-knowledge/object-calisthenics.md` before analysis. Whole-file load: both files are reference catalogs the agent scans end-to-end during a review — the smell→pattern table and the nine rules are independent indexes.

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No multi-module code to analyze"}` when:

- Target is a single configuration file or script
- No module/class structure to evaluate

## Detect

SRP violations:

- Module/class with multiple responsibilities
- God objects/functions doing too much
- Mixed concerns (UI + business logic + data access)

DRY violations:

- Duplicated code blocks
- Copy-paste patterns

Coupling issues:

- Hardcoded dependencies (not injected)
- Circular dependencies
- Change propagation across modules

Nesting:

- >3 levels of conditionals/loops

Organization:

- Inconsistent file/folder structure
- Misplaced abstractions
- Duplicate type definitions — same interface, class, or module defined
  in multiple locations (e.g., an interface file at both project root
  and inside an Interfaces/ subdirectory)
- Non-functional assets in API projects — static web assets (CSS, JS,
  images, fonts) shipped in projects that serve only JSON/XML API
  responses with no UI

Design smells:

- For SRP violations and coupling issues, map to the smell → pattern table in `skill://dev-team-knowledge/design-smells.md#design-smells-pattern-mapping`. Every finding should name the smell, quote the code, and include a refactor sketch.
- For method-level issues (nesting, long methods, flag arguments), check Object Calisthenics rules 1-2 and 7 in `skill://dev-team-knowledge/object-calisthenics.md`. Whole-file load: the nine-rule catalog is short enough that the agent reads the whole file rather than picking specific rule anchors.

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in `skill://dev-team-knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work these structure-review-specific challenges:

- Did you check every module/class for SRP violations, including small ones?
- Did you trace dependency direction? Does business logic depend on infrastructure (not just vice versa)?
- Are there hidden static singletons or global state that aren't injected?
- For every "duplicate code" finding, did you verify it's semantic duplication and not just structural similarity?
- Did you check constructor parameter counts? >5 parameters usually signals SRP violation.
- Are there God objects/Megaclasses you walked past because they're "just how the code is"?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.

## Ignore

Test quality, naming, domain modeling (handled by other agents)
