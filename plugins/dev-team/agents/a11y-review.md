# Accessibility Review

Scope:
- **/*.svelte
- **/*.html
- **/*.jsx
- **/*.tsx
- **/*.vue
- **/*.razor
- **/*.cshtml
- **/*.jsp
Cites: [adversarial-review-protocol]

Scope: UI component and template files only (.svelte, .html, .jsx, .tsx, .vue, .razor, .cshtml, .jsp).
Skip non-component files (utilities, services, stores, configs, tests, routes/pages without markup).

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=accessible, warn=minor gaps, fail=WCAG AA violations
Severity: error=blocks users, warning=degrades experience, suggestion=enhancement
Confidence: high=mechanical fix (add missing attribute, swap element); medium=direction clear, implementation may vary; none=requires human judgment (design decisions, color palette)

Context needs: full-file

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No UI component files found"}` when:

- Target contains only logic files, configs, tests, or utilities
- No .svelte, .html, .jsx, .tsx, .vue, .razor, .cshtml, or .jsp files with component markup present
- Files are non-component modules (stores, services, helpers, route loaders)

## Detect

Semantic HTML:

- div/span used where semantic element fits (nav, main, section, article, aside, header, footer)
- Heading levels skipped (h1 to h3 without h2)
- Lists of items not using ul/ol/li
- Buttons implemented as clickable divs or spans

ARIA attributes:

- Interactive elements missing accessible names (aria-label, aria-labelledby, or visible text)
- Redundant ARIA on elements with implicit roles (role="button" on button)
- aria-hidden="true" on focusable elements
- Missing aria-live for dynamic content updates

Keyboard navigation:

- Click handlers without corresponding keyboard handlers (onkeydown/onkeyup)
- Custom interactive elements missing tabindex
- Focus traps without escape mechanism
- Missing visible focus indicators (outline:none without replacement)

Color and contrast:

- Text color with insufficient contrast against background (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large)
- Information conveyed by color alone without additional indicator
- Disabled states with very low contrast

Form accessibility:

- Inputs missing associated labels (label element or aria-label)
- Required fields without aria-required or required attribute
- Error messages not associated with inputs (aria-describedby)
- Form submission feedback not announced to screen readers

Images and media:

- Images missing alt attribute
- Decorative images not marked with alt="" or aria-hidden="true"
- SVG icons without accessible text

Focus management:

- Modal/dialog not trapping focus
- Focus not returned after modal close
- Dynamic content insertion without focus management
- Route changes not announcing new content

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in `skill://dev-team-knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work these a11y-review-specific challenges:

- Did you examine every component/template file in scope, not just the most obviously interactive one?
- For each contrast finding, did you cite the actual color values and the computed WCAG ratio rather than estimate "looks low"?
- Did you check keyboard operability for EVERY custom interactive element (handler + focusability + visible focus), not just buttons?
- Are there dynamic regions (live updates, route changes, modal open/close) with no announcement/focus-management finding — a suspicious absence?
- For each "missing label" finding, did you verify there's no `aria-labelledby` or visible-text association before flagging?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.

## Ignore

Code style, naming, test coverage, performance (handled by other agents)
