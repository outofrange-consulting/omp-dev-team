## Knowledge Files

Read `skill://dev-team-knowledge/testability-patterns.md` before analysis. Whole-file load: the agent uses the decision flow, the anti-patterns table, and all four patterns as one connected reference when flagging untestable code (missing interfaces, static factories, concrete class coupling). Never recommend a test workaround (reflection, InternalsVisibleTo, mocking concrete classes).

For maintainability findings (duplicated selectors/literals, UI-based setup), consult `skill://dev-team-knowledge/test-automation-maturity.md`. Whole-file load: apply its single-point-of-change check and graduated-disclosure thresholds (don't recommend abstraction below the count threshold).

For assertion-quality findings, consult `skill://dev-team-knowledge/result-verification.md`. Whole-file load: apply all verification patterns (state vs behavior, assertion patterns, rules) when classifying assertion-quality issues.

For oracle-provenance classification (SPEC-DERIVED / INDEPENDENT / CIRCULAR), consult `skill://dev-team-knowledge/oracle-provenance.md`. Whole-file load: apply the taxonomy, detection heuristics, and circular-ratio quality-cap rule to every file reviewed. Report the oracle-provenance ratio in the finding summary when any circular oracles are present. Whole-file load: name the specific verification pattern (Expected Object, Custom Assertion, Guard Assertion, Delta Assertion) that fixes a weak/cluttered/misleading assertion, and enforce one logical condition per test.

## Skills

Whole-file load: each linked SKILL.md is loaded in full when invoked.

- [Feature File Validation](../skills/feature-file-validation/SKILL.md) - invoke when `.feature` files or step definition files are in the target; validates Gherkin quality, determinism, implementation independence, and test automation coverage

**Farley Score is not produced here.** Suite scoring (the `farley-score` skill)
is owned by the orchestrator-level steps — `/test-design` (all existing tests)
and `/build` Step 7 (branch tests). Do not invoke it from this agent: it would
double-score (both steps already call it directly) and add per-checkpoint noise.

## Division of labor with test-smell-review

When `test-smell-review` also runs (e.g. under `/test-design`), defer the
named-smell signals — non-determinism, weak assertions, copy-pasted blocks,
magic literals, mis-layering — to it, per
`skill://dev-team-knowledge/test-review-division-of-labor.md#the-rule-in-one-line`. This agent keeps the tactical
mechanics (missing assertion, missing `await`, mock-reset, testability blockers,
coverage gaps) and detects the deferred signals only when running solo.

## Protocol

Run in two phases — enumerate first, classify second. This stabilizes finding counts across runs by forcing a full pass before applying judgment.

**Phase 1 — Enumerate**: List every test case in scope with:

- Test name / description string
- Assertion method(s) used (or explicit note that no assertion is present)
- Observable setup tier (unit / integration / e2e)

**Phase 2 — Classify**: For each listed test, apply the Detect rules below. Assign severity if flagged.

## Severity Anchors

Calibrate against these worked examples before flagging real code:

| Severity | Pattern | Violation | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `error` | `it('renders', () => { render(<Comp />) })` | No assertion — zero regression protection | Add `expect(screen.getByRole('heading')).toBeInTheDocument()` |
| `error` | `expect(result).toBeTruthy()` | Truthiness-only check; passes on any non-null value | `expect(result).toEqual({ id: 1, name: 'Alice' })` |
| `warning` | `const now = new Date()` inside test body | Unstubbed clock — flaky on midnight, DST transitions | `jest.useFakeTimers()` or inject a clock dependency |
| `warning` | Three tests asserting `expect(output).toContain('success')` identically | No boundary condition distinguishes them — redundant coverage | Collapse or add boundary cases |
| `warning` | Java: `field.setAccessible(true); field.get(obj)` on a private field | Test reaches around encapsulation via reflection — this is a design issue, not a test-hygiene nit | Extract the logic into a collaborator with its own public seam (if standalone); relax visibility to package-private/internal only if a production collaborator independently needs it (never solely for test access); or test the behavior through the existing public API (if already reachable) |
| `suggestion` | Copy-pasted arrange block across 4 tests | Duplication above extraction threshold | Extract to `beforeEach` |
| `suggestion` | `it('test 1', ...)` | Description reveals nothing about behavior | Rename to describe the scenario and expected outcome |

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No test files in target"}` when no test files are found in the target. Use the test-file indicators in `skill://dev-team-knowledge/test-file-indicators.md#indicators-by-language` (JS/TS, C#, Java, BDD/Gherkin). Note: `.feature` files count as test files — if feature files are present, do not skip; run [Feature File Validation](../skills/feature-file-validation/SKILL.md) on them.

## Detect

Coverage gaps:

- Missing edge cases (empty, null, boundary)
- Missing error paths (exceptions, invalid states)
- Missing happy path scenarios

Assertion quality:

- Tests with no assertion — test methods containing no Assert, expect,
  should, verify, or equivalent assertion call. A test that only
  exercises code without asserting outcomes provides zero regression
  protection.
- Non-specific assertions (truthiness-only checks)
- Implementation verification instead of behavior
- Incomplete state verification

Test hygiene:

- Shared mutable state between tests
- Mocks/stubs not reset — JS: `jest.clearAllMocks()` absent; C#: Moq `Mock<T>` reused without `Reset()` or re-instantiation, NSubstitute missing `ClearReceivedCalls()`; Java: Mockito missing `reset()` or `@BeforeEach` re-initialization
- Missing await on async operations — JS/TS: missing `await`; C#: missing `await` on `Task`-returning methods or unchecked `Task` results; Java: unchecked `Future.get()` or missing `CompletableFuture` resolution
- No arrange-act-assert structure
- Misleading test descriptions

Test level efficiency:

- Integration or E2E setup (real DB, real HTTP, large object graphs) used to test a single unit's logic — flag and suggest a unit test with a double instead
- Tests that only exercise third-party library behavior, not the code under test
- Multiple tests asserting identical outcomes with different inputs where no boundary condition distinguishes them (redundant coverage)

Non-determinism sources (flakiness):

- Unstubbed clock access — JS/TS: `Date.now()`, `new Date()`, `Date()`; C#: `DateTime.Now`, `DateTime.UtcNow`, `DateTimeOffset.Now`; Java: `new Date()`, `LocalDateTime.now()`, `Instant.now()`, `System.currentTimeMillis()`
- Unstubbed randomness — JS/TS: `Math.random()`; C#: `new Random()` without injection; Java: `new Random()`, `Math.random()` without injection
- Real network calls, DB connections, or file I/O without test doubles
- Unstubbed timers/delays — JS/TS: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setImmediate` without fake timers; C#: `Task.Delay`, `Thread.Sleep` in test body; Java: `Thread.sleep()` in test body
- Tests that depend on execution order or shared external state between runs
- Uncontrolled async concurrency — JS/TS: `Promise.all` with uncontrolled timing; C#: `Task.WhenAll` without controlled scheduling; Java: unjoined threads or unresolved `CompletableFuture`

Test code quality:

- Copy-pasted assertion blocks that should be extracted into a helper
- Magic literal values in assertions with no explanation of their significance
- Dead test utilities or helpers that are defined but never called
- Low automation maturity (`test-automation-maturity.md`): a volatile detail (selector, endpoint, field name) duplicated raw across many test files (single-point-of-change failure); UI driven to establish preconditions instead of back-door setup — flag only when suite size makes the cost real (graduated thresholds)

Oracle provenance (correctness vs. stability):

Whole-file load: apply the SPEC-DERIVED / INDEPENDENT / CIRCULAR taxonomy from `skill://dev-team-knowledge/oracle-provenance.md`. For each test, classify its expected values by provenance. Report the oracle-provenance ratio (circular / total) in the finding summary when any circular oracles are detected:

- Circular ratio < 20 %: suggestion — add provenance comments to snapshot-based assertions
- Circular ratio 20–50 %: warning — suite has meaningful circular-oracle contamination
- Circular ratio > 50 %: error — suite is circular-oracle-dominated; the file's Test Quality contribution is capped at 60. A circular-oracle-dominated suite verifies stability, not correctness; regressions can go undetected if snapshots are updated without independent verification.

Do not double-report individual snapshot findings when `test-smell-review` is also running in the same session — note the ratio in the summary instead.

Unarmored regions (survivorship-bias gaps):

An **unarmored region** is code that has *neither* test coverage *nor* any sign of historical defensive attention — no negative tests, no error-path assertions, no defensive comments (e.g. `// edge case`, `// TODO: handle`, `// regression: ...`), no related test utility. This is distinct from an ordinary missing-edge-case coverage gap:

- A **coverage gap** is code that is under-tested — some tests exist but a boundary or error path is missing.
- An **unarmored region** is code that has never been examined — no tests AND no sign anyone has looked at it defensively. It is the least-examined code, not merely the least-tested.

Detection: identify functions, branches, or modules where (a) no test exercises the path AND (b) no surrounding context shows historical defensive attention. Flag these as a named "unarmored region" finding, distinct from ordinary coverage-gap findings.

Severity: warning. Suggested fix: prioritize writing tests for unarmored regions before coverage-gap backfill — they carry higher unknown-risk per line of code.

Testability blockers:

- Code under test that cannot be constructed with known values (static factories, singletons, no injectable constructor) — flag as error; per `skill://dev-team-knowledge/testability-patterns.md#pattern-1-constructor-injection-replace-static-factories-singletons`, the production code must change, not the test approach
- Mocking of concrete classes (not interfaces) — flag as warning; extract an interface for the dependency
- Tests using reflection into private members as primary strategy — flag as warning. This is an architecture/encapsulation issue the test is reaching around, not a test-hygiene nit. Detection signatures: Java: `getDeclaredMethod`/`getDeclaredField` + `setAccessible(true)`, `Method.invoke` on a private/protected member; C#: `Type.GetMethod(..., BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance)`, `Type.InvokeMember`; Python: `getattr`/`setattr`/`hasattr` targeting a name-mangled (`_ClassName__attr`) or underscore-prefixed attribute; JS/TS: bracket-notation access into a `private`/non-exported member (e.g. `(obj as any)['_privateMethod']()`), `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor`/`Object.defineProperty` used to reach a non-exported member. Suggested fix — pick by shape of the code, never the generic "expand the public API": (1) extract the private logic into a collaborator with its own public seam, when it's standalone logic worth testing independently; (2) relax visibility to package-private/internal, only when a production collaborator in the same module/assembly independently needs the access (the language must have that tier) — never as a grant solely so the test can reach in, which recreates the `InternalsVisibleTo`/`@VisibleForTesting` anti-pattern below; (3) test the behavior through the class's existing public API, when the private method is already an implementation detail of a public behavior

## Tolerated-Deviation Hunt

Run this cheap grep pass on every core-flow file in scope (non-test source files, not
third-party). Count tolerated-deviation artifacts from the following categories:

- **Disabled tests** — `@Ignore`, `@Disabled`, `xit(`, `xdescribe(`, `test.skip(`,
  `it.skip(`, `[Ignore]`, `[Skip]`, `pytest.mark.skip`, `pytest.mark.xfail` with no
  linked issue or expiry
- **Aged markers** — `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX` comments (any age is a candidate;
  flag as aged when there is no linked ticket or follow-up action)
- **Suppressed warnings** — `@SuppressWarnings`, `#pragma warning disable`,
  `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `eslint-disable`, `pylint: disable` with no explanatory
  comment naming the specific approved exception
- **Relaxed assertions** — assertion strings containing "either … or", "at least",
  "approximately", tolerance widening (e.g. `delta=`, `places=1` in `assertAlmostEqual`)
- **Widened tolerances** — numeric epsilon/tolerance constants changed without a
  comment explaining the regression

**Consolidation rule**: when **≥ 3 of these artifacts appear in the same file**, emit
a **single** named finding:

```json
{
  "severity": "warning",
  "confidence": "medium",
  "file": "<file>",
  "line": <first artifact line>,
  "message": "Fail-safe posture erosion: <N> tolerated-deviation artifacts co-located in this file (<list artifact types and lines>). Each item is a once-flagged deviation now silently tolerated; together they signal accumulated erosion of the test safety net. Distinct from test-audit-disable (which targets mechanically cannot-fail tests) — this check targets the broader pattern of suppressed signals. Remove or link each item to a tracked remediation.",
  "suggestedFix": "For each artifact: either fix the underlying issue and remove the marker, or link it to a tracked issue with an expiry condition. Disabled tests with no remediation plan are the highest priority."
}
```

When fewer than 3 artifacts appear in a file, do not itemize them as individual
low-severity nits — note their presence in the summary only.

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in `skill://dev-team-knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work these test-review-specific challenges:

- For every class below 90% effective coverage, did you identify the SPECIFIC uncovered behavior?
- For each "can't test because of static coupling" — did you verify there's no injectable constructor or interface available?
- Are there tests with no assertion (just "didn't crash")? These provide zero regression protection.
- Are there tests that verify test infrastructure instead of business logic (CanBeMocked, ImplementsInterface, ConstructorSetsField)?
- Did you check for shared mutable state between tests (static fields, module-level singletons)?
- Are there non-determinism sources (unstubbed clock, real network, file I/O) that weren't flagged as flakiness risks?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.
