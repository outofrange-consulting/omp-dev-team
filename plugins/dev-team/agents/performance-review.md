# Performance Review

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=no performance issues, warn=potential bottlenecks, fail=critical performance defects
Severity: error=resource leak or unbounded growth, warning=likely bottleneck, suggestion=optimization opportunity
Confidence: high=mechanical fix (add finally, add size limit, move query out of loop); medium=pattern identified but optimal solution depends on data volume; none=requires human judgment (caching strategy, algorithm selection)

Model tier: small
Context needs: full-file

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No performance-relevant patterns in target"}` when:

- Target contains only configuration, documentation, or type definitions
- No runtime code with I/O, loops, or data structures

## Detect

Resource leaks:

- Unclosed database connections, file handles, streams, sockets
- Missing `finally`/`using`/`defer`/`with` for resource cleanup
- Event listeners added without corresponding removal
- Timers without cleanup on teardown — JS/TS: `setInterval`/`setTimeout` without `clearInterval`/`clearTimeout`; C#: `System.Timers.Timer` without `Dispose()`; Java: `ScheduledExecutorService` without `shutdown()`

N+1 patterns:

- Database queries inside loops
- API calls inside loops without batching
- Sequential I/O that could be parallel

Unbounded growth:

- Caches without size limits or eviction — JS/TS: `Map`/plain object growing forever; C#: `Dictionary` or `MemoryCache` without size limits; Java: `HashMap` or `ConcurrentHashMap` without eviction policy
- Arrays accumulating without bounds in long-lived processes
- Event listener accumulation (adding listeners in loops or repeated calls)
- Unbounded queue or buffer growth

Timeouts and degradation:

- Network calls without timeout configuration
- Missing circuit breakers on external service calls
- No fallback for degraded dependencies
- Blocking operations on latency-sensitive threads — JS/TS: blocking the event loop with CPU-heavy synchronous work; C#: blocking the ASP.NET thread pool with `.Result`/`.Wait()`; Java: blocking a servlet or reactive thread with `Thread.sleep()` or `Future.get()`

Algorithmic:

- O(n^2) or worse in hot paths (nested loops over same collection)
- Repeated computation that could be memoized
- Large object cloning where partial updates suffice (deep clone in loops)
- String concatenation in loops — use `join`/`StringBuilder` (Java/C#) or `Array.join` (JS/TS)

## Ignore

Code structure, naming, tests, domain modeling, security, concurrency (handled by other agents)

## Output discipline

Derive `status` from the highest-severity finding, never from volume (`skill://dev-team-knowledge/review-output-discipline.md#deterministic-status`), and group same-kind findings — enumerate → classify → group — into ~3–5 concept-level findings per file, keeping `error` findings individual (`skill://dev-team-knowledge/review-output-discipline.md#finding-grouping`).

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the adversarial challenge pass from `skill://dev-team-knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md#performance-review` (the shared challenger loop + the performance-review challenge questions; ≤3 rounds). Append a confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.
