# Performance Review

Scope: always
Cites: [adversarial-review-protocol]

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=no performance issues, warn=potential bottlenecks, fail=critical performance defects
Severity: error=resource leak or unbounded growth, warning=likely bottleneck, suggestion=optimization opportunity
Confidence: high=mechanical fix (add finally, add size limit, move query out of loop); medium=pattern identified but optimal solution depends on data volume; none=requires human judgment (caching strategy, algorithm selection)

Context needs: full-file

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No performance-relevant patterns in target"}` when:

- Target contains only configuration, documentation, or type definitions
- No runtime code with I/O, loops, or data structures

## Detect

Resource leaks:

- Unclosed database connections, file handles, streams, sockets
- Missing `finally`/`using`/`defer`/`with` for resource cleanup
- Event listeners added without corresponding removal
- Timers without cleanup on teardown — JS/TS: `setInterval`/`setTimeout` without `clearInterval`/`clearTimeout`; C#: `System.Timers.Timer` without `Dispose()`; Java: `ScheduledExecutorService` without `shutdown()`

N+1 patterns:

- Database queries inside loops
- API calls inside loops without batching
- Sequential I/O that could be parallel

Unbounded growth:

- Caches without size limits or eviction — JS/TS: `Map`/plain object growing forever; C#: `Dictionary` or `MemoryCache` without size limits; Java: `HashMap` or `ConcurrentHashMap` without eviction policy
- Arrays accumulating without bounds in long-lived processes
- Event listener accumulation (adding listeners in loops or repeated calls)
- Unbounded queue or buffer growth

Timeouts and degradation:

- Network calls without timeout configuration
- Missing circuit breakers on external service calls
- No fallback for degraded dependencies
- Blocking operations on latency-sensitive threads — JS/TS: blocking the event loop with CPU-heavy synchronous work; C#: blocking the ASP.NET thread pool with `.Result`/`.Wait()`; Java: blocking a servlet or reactive thread with `Thread.sleep()` or `Future.get()`

Algorithmic:

- O(n^2) or worse in hot paths (nested loops over same collection)
- Repeated computation that could be memoized
- Large object cloning where partial updates suffice (deep clone in loops)
- String concatenation in loops — use `join`/`StringBuilder` (Java/C#) or `Array.join` (JS/TS)

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in `skill://dev-team-knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work these performance-review-specific challenges:

- Did you check every loop and I/O site for N+1 / unbounded growth, not just the largest function?
- For each resource-leak finding, did you confirm there is no cleanup (finally/using/defer/dispose) anywhere on the path?
- For each algorithmic finding, did you verify it's on a hot path with realistic input size, not one-off init?
- Is there a long-lived cache or collection with no eviction-bound finding — a suspicious absence?
- For each "missing timeout" finding, did you check for a timeout configured at the client/global level before flagging the call site?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.

## Ignore
