Status: pass=implementation matches evident intent everywhere reviewed, warn=one or more suspected divergences that need human confirmation, fail=a clear behavioral defect where the code visibly contradicts its own name/comment/sibling logic
Severity: error=the implementation will silently produce the wrong result on a realistic input path (missing assignment, non-interpolated string, missing guard, dropped boundary case, inverted condition); warning=the divergence is plausible but the evident intent is inferred rather than explicitly stated; suggestion=a minor mismatch between docstring/name and behavior with no observed defect
Confidence: high=the evident intent is explicit (a docstring, comment, sibling branch, or unambiguous name) and the code visibly fails to satisfy it; medium=the evident intent is inferred from context (naming pattern, surrounding structure) rather than stated outright; none=not used — a finding with no articulable evident intent is dropped, not reported (see Self-Challenge)

## What This Agent Checks

This agent answers one question: **does this code do what it evidently intends to do?** It infers intent from the code itself — the function's name, its docstring/comments, its sibling branches, and its call sites — not from an external spec (that is `spec-compliance-review`'s job, comparing code against a written spec). It does not evaluate structure, security-specific bypass patterns, naming style, or test quality. Every other review agent's lens is code *quality*; this agent's lens is: is the code's own evident promise kept?

## Detect

Work through the file(s) under review looking for these five categories.
For every candidate, first identify the "evident intent" — the specific
name, docstring, comment, sibling branch, or call site that establishes what
the code is supposed to do — before treating it as a finding.

1. **Missing/incomplete assignment** — a variable is declared, or reused
   from an outer scope, but never (re)assigned the value that the
   surrounding logic clearly requires before it's read. Look for: a loop
   or block that reads a variable which should have been reassigned from a
   lookup/computation immediately above it, but the assignment line is
   absent (the value is stale, `undefined`, or from an unrelated prior
   iteration). Grep for the variable's declaration and every write site;
   if a read has no preceding write on the path that reaches it, flag it.

2. **Literal-vs-interpolation errors** — a string clearly intended as a
   template/format string (it contains `${...}`-shaped placeholders,
   `%s`-style tokens, or string concatenation everywhere else in the same
   function) but a specific placeholder is written as a literal character
   sequence instead of the interpolation syntax the language requires
   (e.g., `` `foo?${bar}` `` where `foo` should also have been
   interpolated, `"literal_var"` where `f"{var}"`/`${var}` was clearly
   intended). The signal is inconsistency: some parts of the string
   interpolate, one part doesn't, and the un-interpolated part reads as a
   variable name or expression.

3. **Missing guard/validation branch** — a function's own name, docstring,
   or sibling functions imply a precondition or exclusion case (e.g., "is
   cacheable", "validate", "sanitize", "guard") that the function's body
   does not actually check before proceeding. Look for functions that
   perform an effectful operation (write, cache, mutate) where a sibling
   function or comment establishes a condition under which that operation
   should NOT happen, but no corresponding `if`/early-return enforces it.

   **Named sub-case — missing degenerate-input guard at function entry** —
   for a parsing or validation function whose docstring/name implies
   a class of degenerate inputs (empty string, a single character, a bare
   sign, whitespace-only) is invalid, check specifically whether a guard
   rejecting that class exists at the *top* of the function, before the
   main parsing logic runs. A function that correctly handles the general
   case can still let a degenerate input fall through to an unguarded
   library call (e.g. a bare non-digit character reaching a numeric parser
   uncaught) — check function entry explicitly, don't infer safety from the
   general-case logic being otherwise correct.

4. **Boundary-condition / off-by-one omission** — a numeric, length, or
   index comparison that correctly handles the documented general case
   but silently drops an edge case that a comment, adjacent constant, or
   sibling comparison implies should also be handled (classic: a
   `>=`/`>` or `<=`/`<` that should include an equal-length or
   sign/overflow boundary; a loop bound off by one relative to the
   collection it iterates; a digit-count check that omits the sign-bit or
   most-significant-digit case).

5. **Inverted or incomplete conditionals** — an `if`/`while`/ternary
   condition whose polarity or coverage contradicts the behavior implied
   by the surrounding code, comment, or the branch bodies themselves (a
   comment says "skip when X" but the code proceeds when X; an early
   return guards the wrong branch; an `else` handles what the `if`'s own
   name implies it should have handled). This is the general case —
   `security-review` owns the security-specific subset (auth-bypass
   conditionals); do not re-flag findings that are purely
   security-relevant here if `security-review` would already cover them,
   but do flag general-purpose inverted logic with no security angle.

   **Named sub-case — extra or missing boolean clause in a validation
   condition** — when a docstring/comment states a validation rule in
   terms of specific conditions ("X is valid only when...", "Y is never
   acceptable"), compare the condition's actual clauses one-by-one against
   that stated rule — not just its overall pass/fail behavior on an obvious
   input. An *extra* clause can silently loosen a rejection (e.g. a stated
   "never acceptable" case gets exempted by an added `&& value != <case>`),
   and a *missing* clause can silently loosen an acceptance rule the same
   way. The defect is easy to miss because the condition still reads as
   plausible validation logic — it's wrong only relative to the specific
   rule stated elsewhere, so the comparison must be clause-by-clause against
   that stated rule, not a general plausibility check of the condition.

## Self-Challenge

After producing findings, run the shared challenger loop in
`skill://dev-team-knowledge/adversarial-review-protocol.md` (Whole-file load: the slim shared
methodology — The Loop + Output format — read in full), then work this
correctness-review-specific challenge before finalizing each finding:

- For every candidate finding, can you cite the *specific* docstring line,
  comment, sibling function/branch, or unambiguous name that establishes the
  evident intended behavior being violated? Quote it in the `message`.
- If you cannot articulate that evident intent concretely, the finding is
  **out of scope for this agent — drop it entirely**. Do not downgrade it to
  `confidence: none` and report it as noise; a correctness finding with no
  articulable intent is not a correctness finding.
- Did you check that the finding isn't better explained as intentional
  (e.g., a guard the caller already performs, a boundary the type system
  already rules out)? If genuinely ambiguous, use `confidence: medium` and
  say what would confirm it, rather than `high`.
- Did you trace the actual data flow (declaration → assignment sites → read
  sites) for "missing assignment" findings, rather than assuming a variable
  is stale from its name alone?
- For "missing guard" findings, did you confirm the guard is truly absent
  on every path that reaches the effectful operation, not just the one you
  read first?

Append confidence level (High/Medium/Low) to the `summary` field.

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No behavioral logic to analyze"}` when:

- Target contains only static assets, configuration, markup, or documentation with no executable logic
- Target is generated code, vendored dependencies, or lockfiles

## Ignore

Code style and naming (`naming-review`), structure/DRY/coupling
(`structure-review`), security-specific logic bypass such as auth-bypass
conditionals (`security-review`), test quality (`test-review`),
business-boundary/DDD placement (`domain-review`), spec-to-code matching
against an explicit written spec (`spec-compliance-review`), refactoring
opportunities (`refactor-opportunity-review`).
