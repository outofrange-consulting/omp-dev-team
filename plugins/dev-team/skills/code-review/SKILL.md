# Code Review

Role: orchestrator. Route work to review agents; do not review code yourself. Pass each agent's tier alias (from its `model:` frontmatter) when dispatching — the PreToolUse hook `hooks/agent-model-resolve.sh` resolves it to the active snapshot per the Resolution Procedure in `agents/orchestrator.md`.

Output templates and JSON schemas: [`code-review/output-format.md`](code-review/output-format.md). Example report: [`code-review/examples/sample-report.md`](code-review/examples/sample-report.md).

## Orchestrator constraints

1. **Do not review code yourself.** Delegate all semantic analysis to review agents.
2. **Minimize context per agent.** Pass only what each agent's `Context needs` field requires.
3. **Route to the right model tier.** Each agent's `model:` frontmatter declares its tier alias (`haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`); the PreToolUse hook `hooks/agent-model-resolve.sh` resolves it to the active snapshot per `agents/orchestrator.md` → Resolution Procedure. Do not override the frontmatter value.
4. **Run deterministic gates first.** Lint, type-check, secret scan are cheaper than AI. Stop if they fail.
5. **Return structured results.** Aggregate agent JSON; do not add your own findings.
6. **Be concise.** Tables and JSON, no preambles, no filler.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

| Flag | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `--agent <name>` | Run only the named agent (delegates to `/review-agent`) |
| `--since <ref>` | Review files changed since the ref (`git diff --name-only <ref>...HEAD`) |
| `--path <dir>` | Review only files in this directory |
| `--all` | Force full-repository review even when uncommitted changes exist |
| `--json` | Output aggregated JSON instead of prose (for CI integration) |
| `--init-risks` | Scaffold `ACCEPTED-RISKS.md` from `templates/ACCEPTED-RISKS.md.tmpl` if absent. Exits non-zero without overwriting if present. Schema: `skill://dev-team-knowledge/accepted-risks-schema.md`. |
| `--force` | Skip pre-flight gates **and the documentation-only short-circuit** (forces a full review of doc-only changes). **Requires `--reason "<text>"`** — logged to `metrics/override-audit.jsonl`. |
| `--reason "<text>"` | Override justification (required with `--force`) |
| `--static-analysis` / `--no-static-analysis` | Force on/off the static analysis pre-pass (Semgrep, ESLint, TypeScript, pylint). Auto-enabled when tools are detected. |
| `--background` | Drift review mode — review default branch for documentation, naming, and structural drift. Runs doc-review, arch-review, naming-review, structure-review only. Skips pre-flight gates. |
| (no flags) | **Auto-scope**: review uncommitted changes if any exist, otherwise full repository |

```

## Steps

### 1. Determine target files

Priority order:

1. `--path <dir>` — files in that directory (exclude node_modules, .git, dist, build, coverage)
2. `--since <ref>` — `git diff --name-only <ref>...HEAD`
3. `--all` — all source files
4. **Auto-scope** (no flags): run `git diff --name-only` + `git diff --cached --name-only`, combine and dedupe. If non-empty, review those files. If empty, review the full repository.

**Scope validation** (full-repo paths only):

| File count | Action |
|---|---|
| ≤200 | Proceed |
| 201–500 | Warn: "Reviewing {N} files — consider `--path` to narrow scope." Proceed. |
| >500 | Warn + confirm: "Reviewing {N} files is expensive. Continue?" Wait. |

**Documentation-only short-circuit.** After the target set is known, classify each file. A file is **documentation** when it matches a doc type or path:

- extension `.md`, `.mdx`, `.markdown`, `.rst`, `.txt`, `.adoc`
- any path under a `docs/` directory
- a root doc: `README*`, `CHANGELOG*`, `CONTRIBUTING*`, `LICENSE*`, `NOTICE*`, `AUTHORS*`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT*`

…**except functional Claude-config markdown, which is never documentation** (it drives agent/skill/command behavior and must be reviewed): any path containing a `.claude/` segment, or under `agents/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `skill://dev-team-knowledge/`, or `templates/agents/`. Treat `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` as functional config too, not documentation.

If **every** target file is documentation, short-circuit:

1. Emit: `Documentation-only changeset ({N} files) — skipping code review. Re-run with --force --reason "<text>" to review anyway.`
2. If the review was auto-scoped to uncommitted changes, write the `.review-passed` gate file (per step 9) so the pre-commit hook allows the commit.
3. In `--json` mode, emit `{"status": "skipped", "reason": "documentation-only", "files": [<list>]}` instead.
4. **Stop.** Do not run pre-flight gates, static analysis, or any agent.

**Bypass:** the short-circuit does **not** apply with `--force` (with `--reason`), `--agent <name>`, or `--background` (drift review always inspects docs).

### 1b. Check for institutional context

If `REVIEW-CONTEXT.md` exists at the repo root, read it and pass its contents to every agent in step 4, prefixed with: "Institutional context provided for this review:". This file is optional.

### 1c. Probe for optional MCP tools

| Tool | Check | Use |
|---|---|---|
| RoslynMCP | `get_code_metrics` / `search_symbols` available | C# metrics, compiler diagnostics |
| Code knowledge graph | `list_repos` available | Cross-repo dependency mapping |
| Documentation MCP | wiki/docs search available | Architecture docs |
| Semgrep | `which semgrep` | SAST context for security-review |

Pass availability info to each agent so they can use enhanced tools or fall back to Glob/Grep/Read. Include in the final report per `skill://dev-team-knowledge/review-template.md`.

### 2. Pre-flight gates

Skip entirely if `--background`. If `--force` without `--reason`, halt:

```
ERROR: --force requires --reason "<justification>".
```

If `--force` with `--reason`, append an entry to `metrics/override-audit.jsonl` per the schema in [`output-format.md`](code-review/output-format.md#override-audit-log-entry-step-2---force-path), then proceed to step 3.

Otherwise run these in sequence (stop on first failure):

1. **Lint**: `npx eslint` (or project lint command) on target files.
2. **Type check**: `npx tsc --noEmit` if `tsconfig.json` exists.
3. **Secret scan**: grep target files for `(?i)(api[_-]?key|secret|password|token)\s*[:=]\s*['"][^'"]{8,}`.
4. **Semgrep SAST**: `semgrep scan --config auto --quiet --json` on target files if installed. ERROR-severity → fail. WARNING-severity → continue, include in report. Save findings for security-review context.
5. **Pipeline-red check**: `gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 1 --json conclusion -q '.[0].conclusion'` if `gh` is available. If the last CI run failed, warn: "Pipeline is red. Fix CI before adding new code. Use `--force` to override."

Skip any gate silently if its tool is unavailable.

### 2b. Static analysis pre-pass

Skip if `--no-static-analysis` or `--background`.

Follow the detection, execution, and deduplication procedure in [`skill://static-analysis-integration`](../skill://static-analysis-integration). Output is structured findings injected into agent context in step 4. **This step does not gate execution** — it collects context only.

If Semgrep already ran in the pre-flight gate, reuse those findings. Do not run Semgrep twice.

### 3. Determine enabled agents

If `--background`: run only `doc-review`, `arch-review`, `naming-review`, `structure-review`. Skip all others.

Otherwise enumerate review agents from `agents/*.md` (identified by a `Model tier:` field in body). All are enabled by default.

**Language-agnostic agents always run** regardless of tech stack: `doc-review`, `arch-review`, `claude-setup-review`, `token-efficiency-review`.

If `review-config.json` exists at the repo root, honor its per-agent `"enabled": false` flags.

### 4. Run each enabled agent

Spawn agents as parallel subagents in a single message using the `task` tool.

- **File scope**: pass only files matching each agent's declared scope. Skip the agent if no files match.
- **Context payload** (controlled by the agent's `Context needs`):
  - `diff-only` → diff output only (for auto-scope or `--since` only)
  - `full-file` → complete files
  - `project-structure` → full files + directory tree
  - When reviewing full repository (clean auto-scope, `--all`, or `--path`), always pass full files.
- **Model**: pass each agent's declared tier alias (`haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`) from its `model:` frontmatter. The PreToolUse hook `hooks/agent-model-resolve.sh` resolves the tier to the active snapshot per `agents/orchestrator.md` → Resolution Procedure.
- **Static analysis context**: if step 2b produced findings, inject into every agent's prompt using the format in `skill://static-analysis-integration`: "These issues were detected by static analysis. Do not re-report them. Focus on semantic concerns."
- **Per-agent output**: `{"agentName": "<name>", "status": "pass|warn|fail", "issues": [], "summary": "..."}` (full schema in `output-format.md`).

Wait for all agents to complete before aggregating.

### 5. Aggregate results

#### 5a. Apply ACCEPTED-RISKS.md

If `ACCEPTED-RISKS.md` exists at the repo root, parse its `rules:` YAML frontmatter per `skill://dev-team-knowledge/accepted-risks-schema.md`. For each finding, check rules in declaration order; the first match suppresses and emits one audit entry:

```
SUPPRESSED: <file>:<line> [<rule_id>] by ACCEPTED-RISKS rule <rule.id>
```

- Expired rules become inert: stop suppressing, emit a WARN naming the rule and owner, list in an Expiry Report section.
- Rules with `broad: true` (wildcard `rule_id` or multi-file globs) emit an informational notice for auditor attention.
- Schema-invalid rules fail the run with a parse error naming the rule id.

Suppressed findings are removed from scoring, listed under "Suppressed by ACCEPTED-RISKS" in the report (grouped by rule id), and bypass the fix loop.

#### 5b. Health scoring

Read `skill://dev-team-knowledge/review-rubric.md` for the formula. Compute the overall health score; security failures auto-escalate to 🔴.

Classify each issue by actionability:

| Severity | Confidence | Actionable? |
|---|---|---|
| error or warning | high or medium | **Yes** — auto-apply |
| error or warning | none | No — report only (human judgment) |
| suggestion | any | No — report only |

**Actionable issues** drive the fix loop.

### 6. Present findings and ask for direction

If zero actionable issues, skip to step 7.

Otherwise present the Review Findings prompt (template: [`output-format.md`](code-review/output-format.md#review-findings-prompt-interactive--step-6)) and ask: **"Fix these issues automatically, or save as report only?"**

- "Fix" / "apply" / "yes" → step 6a
- "Report" / "no" / "don't fix" → step 7 (no code modified)

**Exception — non-interactive mode**: if running inside `/build` or `/pr`, skip this prompt and proceed to the fix loop. The caller owns the human gate (the orchestrator's Phase 3 approval for `/build`; the pre-PR confirmation for `/pr`).

### 6a. Review-fix loop

```
iteration = 1
MAX_ITERATIONS = 5

while actionable_issues > 0 AND iteration ≤ MAX_ITERATIONS:
    1. Apply fixes for all actionable issues (file-by-file, top-to-bottom by line)
    2. After each iteration's fixes, run the project's test suite.
       If tests fail, revert the last fix that broke them and mark the
       issue [auto-fix failed — human review required].
    3. Re-run only the agents that reported actionable issues, against only
       the modified files. Carry forward statuses of agents that passed.
    4. Re-aggregate. Reclassify remaining issues.
    5. iteration += 1

if iteration > MAX_ITERATIONS AND actionable_issues > 0:
    escalate to human with remaining issues
```

**Exit conditions**:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Zero actionable issues | Exit → step 7 |
| Iteration limit (5) | Exit → escalate |
| Same issues persist | Exit — not converging |
| Tests fail after fix and revert | Mark issue human-required; continue |

Track each iteration for the report — template in [`output-format.md`](code-review/output-format.md#review-fix-loop-iteration-log-step-6a-iv).

### 7. Generate report

Read `skill://dev-team-knowledge/review-template.md` for the structure.

If `--json`, emit the aggregated JSON object per the schema in [`output-format.md`](code-review/output-format.md#aggregated-json-result---json-flag) and stop.

Otherwise emit the prose summary using the Code Review Summary template in [`output-format.md`](code-review/output-format.md#code-review-summary-report-step-7-prose-mode). Append the iteration table.

### 8. Save correction prompts for remaining issues

For issues NOT auto-fixed (confidence: none, auto-fix failed, or suggestions), generate one correction prompt per issue using the Correction prompt schema in [`output-format.md`](code-review/output-format.md#correction-prompt-json). Save to `corrections/`. These can be addressed manually or via `/apply-fixes`.

### 9. Write pre-commit gate file

If the review was auto-scoped to uncommitted changes and the overall status is `pass` or `warn`, write `.review-passed` so the pre-commit hook allows the next commit. Use the **shared gate-hash helper** so the writer and the pre-commit hook compute the hash identically — it hashes the staged **content** (the cached patch), not just the file paths (#193), so any edit after review invalidates the gate:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/lib/review-gate-hash.sh > .review-passed
```

Stage the exact changes you reviewed (`git add` them) before writing the gate, so the staged content the hook hashes matches what was reviewed. If `git diff --cached` is empty (you reviewed unstaged changes), stage them first — the gate binds to the staged patch by design.

If overall status is `fail`, do **not** write the gate file — the pre-commit hook will keep blocking until issues are resolved and the review re-run.
