"""Consolidate per-slice section artifacts into one deduplicated report.

Split into a **pure** ``consolidate(sections)`` (takes a list of section dicts,
returns the aggregated object) and a thin ``main()`` that reads
``.dev-team-reports/code-review/raw/section-*.json`` and calls it — the same
main-wraps-pure convention as ``check_version_drift.py``/``lesson_validate.py``,
so the aggregation logic is unit-tested with plain dicts and no filesystem.

Consolidation:
- Dedupe findings by ``file:line`` — one entry, reporting agents merged into an
  ``agents[]`` array, severity = the single highest enum (per SKILL.md step 5c).
- Recurring-theme rollup — a review dimension (agent) whose findings recur across
  two or more slices, so a systemic pattern surfaces above per-slice noise.
- Disclose which slices ran the reduced (declarative) panel.
