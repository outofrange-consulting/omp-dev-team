# Output Format Reference

## Per-agent JSON result

```json
{
  "agentName": "structure-review",
  "status": "pass|warn|fail|skip",
  "modelTier": "mid",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "error|warning|suggestion",
      "confidence": "high|medium|none",
      "file": "src/auth/login.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "message": "God object: AuthController handles login, registration, and password reset",
      "suggestedFix": "Split into LoginController, RegistrationController, and PasswordResetController"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "2 issues found: 1 error, 1 warning"
}
```

### `confidence` field values

| Value | Meaning | `apply-fixes` behavior |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| `high` | Mechanical fix; correct with high certainty | Auto-apply |
| `medium` | Direction right; tradeoffs possible | Present as suggested diff — require confirmation |
| `none` | Requires human judgment | Present finding only; do not generate correction prompt |

## Aggregated JSON result (`--json` flag)

```json
{
  "overall": "pass|warn|fail",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-01T12:00:00Z",
  "targetFiles": 42,
  "preFlightPassed": true,
  "agents": [
    {"agentName": "test-review", "status": "pass", "modelTier": "mid", "issues": [], "summary": "..."}
  ],
  "totals": {"errors": 0, "warnings": 2, "suggestions": 1},
  "tokenEstimate": {
    "totalInputFiles": 15000,
    "agentCount": 11,
    "contextStrategy": "diff-only|full-file|mixed"
  },
  "topFindings": [
    {
      "severity": "error|warning|suggestion",
      "agents": ["structure-review", "complexity-review"],
      "file": "src/api/handler.ts",
      "line": 15,
      "message": "God object: handler mixes routing, validation, and persistence"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "WARN (N agents passed, N warned, N failed). N total issues."
}
```

The `tokenEstimate` field provides rough cost observability:

- `totalInputFiles`: approximate character count of all input files passed to agents
- `agentCount`: number of agents that ran (not skipped)
- `contextStrategy`: whether diff-only, full-file, or a mix was used

The `topFindings` array is the consolidated cross-agent view — one entry per
distinct `file:line`, so a finding surfaced by several agents appears once:

- `severity` is the **single highest** enum (`error` > `warning` > `suggestion`)
  for that finding — never a slash- or comma-joined string.
- `agents` is an explicit array of the reporting agents. Multi-agent
  attribution lives here; never join multiple values into `severity` or an
  `agent` scalar.

**`--json` output contract.** When `--json` is set, the object above is the
run's *only* output: printed to stdout, and no `corrections/*.json` files or
`.review-passed` gate file are written — regardless of scope (`--path`,
`--since`, `--all`, auto-scope) or how many issues were found. This holds
whether `--json` was reached directly or via `/pr`'s call into `/code-review
--json` (see SKILL.md steps 7–9).

## Per-slice section artifact (sliced mode)

Written by `scripts/ledger.py` → `write_section` to
`.dev-team-reports/code-review/raw/section-<id>.json` as each slice completes,
then dropped from orchestrator context (persist-and-drop). `scripts/consolidate.py`
reads these back for the final report.

```json
{
  "schema": "code-review-section/v1",
  "id": "0001",
  "files": ["src/auth/login.ts", "src/auth/session.ts"],
  "is_declarative": false,
  "panel": ["correctness-review", "structure-review"],
  "findings": [
    {"severity": "warning", "confidence": "medium", "agent": "structure-review", "file": "src/auth/login.ts", "line": 42, "message": "..."}
  ]
}
```

- `id` is the slice id; the filename is `section-<id>.json`.
- `panel` lists the agents that **actually ran** for this slice — a reduced-panel
  (declarative) slice lists only `correctness-review` and `structure-review`, so
  a reader can tell "fewer findings" from "fewer reviewers ran".
- `findings` use the per-agent `issues[]` shape above **plus an `agent` field**
  naming the review dimension that reported each one. Because a slice's whole
  panel writes into one flat `findings[]` list, that `agent` tag is what lets
  `consolidate.py` merge reporting agents per `file:line` and roll up recurring
  themes — omitting it yields empty `agents[]` arrays and no themes.

### Schema-drift tolerance (#1261)

Real review-agent output drifts from this schema — agents return the native
`{status, issues, summary}` shape, key the list as `issues` (the per-agent key)
instead of `findings` (the section key), or add extra top-level keys. The
aggregator absorbs these variants deterministically rather than miscounting:

- `consolidate.py`'s `consolidate()` reads a section's findings from `findings`
  **or** `issues` (canonical first), so a mis-keyed list is aggregated, never
  silently counted as zero. A value present but not a list degrades to "no
  findings" rather than crashing.
- `consolidate.normalize_agent_result(raw, agent_name=None)` is the extraction
  contract for folding one agent's raw result into a section's flat `findings[]`:
  it pulls the list from either key, ignores extra keys (`status`, `summary`),
  and tags each finding with its reporting `agent` (`raw["agentName"]`, else the
  passed `agent_name`). Non-dict input degrades to `[]`; it never raises.

This tolerance is a safety net for silent drift, **not** a licence to emit the
wrong shape — the per-agent contract above (`issues[]`) remains authoritative.

## Progress ledger (sliced mode)

Written by `init_ledger` to `.dev-team-reports/code-review/ledger.json`, updated to
`done` as each slice's section artifact lands. Inspectable/interruptible — a
partial ledger is always valid JSON.

```json
{
  "schema": "code-review-ledger/v1",
  "cap": 50,
  "slices": [
    {"id": "0001", "files": ["src/auth/login.ts"], "is_declarative": false, "status": "pending"}
  ]
}
```

- `cap` is the per-slice file cap the run partitioned with; `--resume` **refuses**
  a different cap rather than silently repartitioning (see `sliced-mode.md`).
- `status` is `pending` until the slice's section artifact exists, then `done`.
  The artifact on disk — not this status field — is the source of truth for
  `--resume`.

## Consolidated aggregate (sliced mode)

Produced by `scripts/consolidate.py` → `consolidate(sections)` from all
`section-*.json` artifacts. It extends the aggregated `--json` object above with
two sliced-only fields, and reuses the same `topFindings` dedup contract
(one entry per distinct `file:line`, reporting agents merged into `agents[]`,
severity = the single highest enum).

```json
{
  "sliced": true,
  "sliceCount": 24,
  "overall": "warn",
  "totals": {"errors": 0, "warnings": 5, "suggestions": 3},
  "topFindings": [
    {"severity": "warning", "agents": ["structure-review", "complexity-review"], "file": "src/api/handler.ts", "line": 15, "message": "..."}
  ],
  "recurringThemes": [
    {"agent": "structure-review", "slices": ["0003", "0007", "0011"], "occurrences": 9}
  ],
  "reducedPanelSlices": ["0002", "0019"],
  "summary": "WARN across 24 slices — 0 errors, 5 warnings, 3 suggestions; 1 recurring theme(s)."
}
```

- `summary`: a one-line roll-up (status, slice count, totals, theme count).
- `malformedArtifacts` (optional): present only when a `section-*.json` was
  unreadable — an array of the offending paths; `main()` also reports each to
  stderr and exits non-zero, so a bad artifact is never silently dropped.
- `recurringThemes`: review dimensions (by `agent`) whose findings recur across
  **two or more slices** — the systemic-pattern rollup (e.g. the same god-class
  or leak flagged in many modules). `slices` lists the affected slice ids;
  `occurrences` is the total finding count for that dimension. A dimension
  appearing in only one slice is **not** a theme.
- `reducedPanelSlices`: the ids of slices that ran the reduced (declarative)
  panel — so a reader can tell "fewer findings" from "fewer reviewers ran".

## Correction prompt JSON

```json
{
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "confidence": "high|medium",
  "category": "structure-review",
  "instruction": "Fix: God object handles too many concerns (Suggested: Split into focused controllers)",
  "context": "Line 42 in src/auth/login.ts",
  "affectedFiles": ["src/auth/login.ts"]
}
```

Severity mapping: error→high, warning→medium, suggestion→low.

Correction prompts are only generated for issues with `confidence: high` or `confidence: medium`. Issues with `confidence: none` are included in the review report but do not produce correction prompts — they require human judgment and must be resolved manually before merging.

## Status rules

- **pass**: Zero issues
- **warn**: Issues found, none are errors
- **fail**: At least one error-severity issue
- **skip**: Agent is inapplicable to the target (e.g., no JS/TS files for js-fp-review)

## Model tier values

Each agent declares a `Model tier` field that controls which model runs it:

| Tier | Model | Use for |
| ------ | ------- | --------- |
| `small` | Haiku | Pattern matching, thresholds, naming checks |
| `mid` | Sonnet | Structural analysis, test quality, mutation detection |
| `frontier` | Opus | Security analysis, domain modeling, semantic reasoning |

## Context needs values

Each agent declares a `Context needs` field that controls what input it receives:

| Value | Input | When to use |
| ------- | ------- | ------------- |
| `diff-only` | Git diff output only | Pattern-matching agents (naming, FP) |
| `full-file` | Complete file contents | Agents needing function-level context |
| `project-structure` | Full files + directory tree | Agents reasoning about architecture |

## Review Findings prompt (interactive — step 6)

When actionable issues exist, present this prompt before any fix action. **This
prompt is bypassed under `--json` (or `--yes`)**: those runs are contractually
non-interactive and default to report-only (no code modified) — see SKILL.md
step 6, exception (a).

```text
## Review Findings

Found N actionable issues (N errors, N warnings) that can be
auto-fixed, plus N issues requiring human review.

Actionable issues by agent:
- structure-review: 3 (2 error, 1 warning)
- naming-review: 2 (2 warning)
- js-fp-review: 1 (1 error)

Options:
1. **Fix** — Auto-fix actionable issues and re-run review
   (up to 5 iterations until clean)
2. **Report only** — Save all findings to a report without
   modifying any code
```

## Review-Fix Loop iteration log (step 6a-iv)

```text
## Review-Fix Loop

| Iteration | Actionable Issues | Fixed | Remaining | Agents Re-run |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 1         | 7                 | 6     | 1         | 3             |
| 2         | 1                 | 1     | 0         | 1             |

Loop converged in 2 iterations.
```

If the loop did not converge:

```text
Loop stopped after 5 iterations. 2 issues remain:
- [security-review] SQL injection at src/db/query.ts:42 [auto-fix failed — human review required]
- [domain-review] Abstraction leak at src/api/handler.ts:15 [confidence: none — human review required]
```

## Code Review Summary report (step 7, prose mode)

```text
# Code Review Summary

| Agent              | Status | Issues | Fixed | Model Tier |
|--------------------|--------|--------|-------|------------|
| test-review        | PASS   | 0      | —     | mid        |
| structure-review   | PASS   | 2      | 2     | mid        |
| security-review    | WARN   | 1      | 0     | frontier   |
| ...                | ...    | ...    | ...   | ...        |

Overall: WARN after 2 fix iterations (N agents passed, N warned, N failed)
Total issues found: N | Auto-fixed: N | Human review required: N
```

After the summary, list remaining issues grouped by file, sorted by severity. Mark each with: `[confidence: none]`, `[auto-fix failed]`, or `[suggestion]`. Append the iteration table above.

## Override audit log entry (step 2, `--force` path)

Append to `.claude/metrics/override-audit.jsonl` (create if missing):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
  "branch": "<current branch>",
  "triggeredBy": "--force",
  "reason": "<value of --reason>",
  "targetFiles": ["<file list>"],
  "gatesSkipped": ["lint", "type-check", "secret-scan", "semgrep", "pipeline-red"]
}
```
