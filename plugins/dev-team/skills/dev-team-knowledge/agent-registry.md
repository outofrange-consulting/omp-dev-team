# Agent & Skill Registry (Full)

This file contains the complete registry tables. CLAUDE.md references this file for on-demand loading — the orchestrator reads it when routing decisions require the full catalog.

## Team Agents

## Review Agents

Spawned by the orchestrator during Phase 3 inline checkpoints and full `/code-review` runs. Each agent declares a tier alias in its `model:` frontmatter; the PreToolUse hook `hooks/agent-model-resolve.sh` resolves it to the active snapshot per the **Resolution Procedure** in `agents/orchestrator.md`.
