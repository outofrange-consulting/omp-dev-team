description: >-
  Multi-workflow coverage baseline worker. Detects the repo's coverage tool
  from its build manifest, runs it, records the resulting line+branch
  percentages as the baseline, and posts the number to the parent issue (or
  local `FEATURE.md`). This number is the floor every later phase must improve
  on. Called by `/test-improve` (Phase 2) via `--workflow test-improve`.

# Coverage Baseline

Role: worker. Captures the true baseline coverage of the repo *after* cannot-fail tests have been disabled so the floor isn't inflated by tautologies.

You have been invoked with the `/coverage-baseline` command.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

- Positional: `<repo-path>`.
- `--parent <issue-url>` — parent issue URL on the resolved tracker (or empty for local-files mode).
- `--repo-slug <slug>` — namespace under `.claude/memory/<workflow>/`.
- `--workflow <name>` — the workflow namespace under `.claude/memory/`. Defaults to `test-improve`. Orchestrators pass their own namespace (e.g. `/test-improve` passes `test-improve` for its Phase-2 baseline).

If `<repo-path>` is absent, ask the operator.

## Steps

### 1. Detect the coverage tool

Read the build manifest at the repo root and pick the appropriate command:

| Manifest | Default coverage command |
|---|---|
| `package.json` (JS/TS) | `npm test -- --coverage` (or `pnpm test --coverage`, `yarn test --coverage`) |
| `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` | `pytest --cov=. --cov-report=json` |
| `pom.xml` | `mvn test jacoco:report` |
| `build.gradle*` | `./gradlew test jacocoTestReport` |
| `*.csproj` | `dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=json` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo llvm-cov --json` |
| `go.mod` | `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...` + `go tool cover -func=coverage.out` |

If the repo has its own coverage script (e.g. `npm run coverage`, `make coverage`), prefer that — detect via `package.json#scripts.coverage`, the `Makefile`, or a documented run target in `README.md`. If detection is ambiguous, ask the operator for the exact command.

### 2. Run coverage

Run the chosen command from `<repo-path>`. Capture stdout, stderr, and the exit code.

If the run fails:

- Surface the first error.
- Do NOT write a baseline. The floor must be a true measurement.
- Stop.

### 3. Parse line + branch percentages

For each tool, parse the report into `{ "line": <pct>, "branch": <pct>, "tool": "<name>", "raw_path": "<file>" }`:

- Istanbul / Jest / Vitest → `coverage/coverage-summary.json` → `total.lines.pct` + `total.branches.pct`.
  - **If `coverage-summary.json` is absent** (the `json-summary` reporter wasn't enabled — see #1086), do not abort. Fall back, in order, to another emitted report and derive the two percentages from it:
    - `coverage/coverage-final.json` (Istanbul `json` reporter) → sum each file's statement/branch hit counts (`s`/`b`) into totals, then `line = covered_statements / total_statements * 100`, `branch = covered_branches / total_branches * 100`.
    - `coverage/lcov.info` → tally `LF`/`LH` for lines and `BRF`/`BRH` for branches across all records; `line = ΣLH/ΣLF * 100`, `branch = ΣBRH/ΣBRF * 100` (branch `null` when `BRF` totals 0).
    - `coverage/clover.xml` → read the project-level `<metrics>` element: `line = coveredstatements/statements * 100`, `branch = coveredconditionals/conditionals * 100`.
  - Note in the persisted baseline which report was used (`raw_report`). Recommend the operator run `/setup` (which now checks coverage readiness) or add the `json-summary` reporter so future runs use the canonical summary.
- pytest-cov → `coverage.json` → `totals.percent_covered` (and branch via `--branch`).
- JaCoCo → `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv` → sum line/branch missed+covered.
- Coverlet → `coverage.json` → `summary.linecoverage`, `summary.branchcoverage`.
- cargo-llvm-cov → `--json` → `data[0].totals.lines.percent`, `…branches.percent`.
- Go → `go tool cover -func` → `total:` line; branch coverage isn't native, report `null` and flag.

### 4. Persist the baseline

Write `.claude/memory/<workflow>/<slug>/baseline-coverage.json`:

```json
{
  "phase": 3,
  "captured_at": "<ISO-8601>",
  "tool": "jest",
  "line_pct": 41.2,
  "branch_pct": 28.7,
  "raw_report": "coverage/coverage-summary.json",
  "disabled_test_count": 47
}
```

`disabled_test_count` is included **only** when `.claude/memory/<workflow>/<slug>/disabled-tests.json` exists (present when a caller ran `/test-audit-disable` first); omit the field otherwise. `phase` carries the calling workflow's phase number when it has one, and may be omitted for workflows without numbered phases.

Append a baseline summary to the workflow's baseline memory file (for `/test-improve`, `.claude/memory/<workflow>/<slug>/phase-2.md`; other workflows write to their own baseline phase file). Just the coverage block — auditing is a separate worker.

### 5. Post to the parent

**Tracker mode** — append a markdown block to the parent issue's description (the resolved CLI was recorded in Phase 1):

```markdown
## Phase-3 baseline (captured <ISO-8601>)
- Coverage tool: <tool>
- Line: <pct>%
- Branch: <pct>% (or "not native — see notes")
- Cannot-fail tests disabled in Phase 3: <count> (omit this line when no `disabled-tests.json` exists for the workflow)
- Quality targets: line ≥ 90% · branch ≥ 90% · mutants = 0 · determinism = 100% · wall-clock = fastest achievable
```

Use the same CLI pattern Phase 1 resolved. Examples:

```bash
# GitHub
gh issue edit <parent-id> --body-file <(gh issue view <parent-id> --json body -q .body; echo; cat phase-3-block.md)

# Azure DevOps
az boards work-item update --id <parent-id> --description "$(az boards work-item show --id <parent-id> --query 'fields."System.Description"' -o tsv)<append>"

# GitLab
glab issue note add <parent-iid> --message "$(cat phase-3-block.md)"

# Jira
acli jira workitem comment add --key <parent-key> --body "$(cat phase-3-block.md)"
```

**Local-files mode** — append the block to `.claude/plans/<workflow>/FEATURE.md` under a `## Metrics history` heading (create the heading if missing).

### 6. Report

Print:

- Line %, branch %.
- The path to `baseline-coverage.json`.
- The destination (parent issue URL or `FEATURE.md`).
- A reminder that the orchestrator's human gate runs next.

## Notes

- Coverage tools may legitimately differ by repo; never replace the repo's own script with a generic one unless detection fails. Operator override always wins.
- The "fastest pre-merge wall-clock" target is not captured here — that's recorded by `/quality-targets-converge` once the full suite is in place. Baseline is line + branch only.
- For Go (and any tool without native branch coverage), `branch_pct` is `null` and `phase-3.md` flags the gap so the operator can decide whether to install an alternate coverage tool or waive the target.
