  Analyze review agent effectiveness, model routing, and orchestration complexity
  against actual usage data. Produces a report of harness components that may be
  candidates for simplification or removal. Use periodically to prevent harness
  staleness as model capabilities improve. Audits the dev-team plugin's OWN
  harness from runtime metrics — not your project repo's readiness (for that,
  use /agent-readiness).

# Harness Audit

Role: orchestrator. This command analyzes harness effectiveness — it does not modify agents or configuration.

You have been invoked with the `/harness-audit` command.

> **Not `/agent-readiness`.** This audits the **dev-team plugin's own harness**
> (review-agent effectiveness, model tiers, orchestration) from accumulated
> runtime metrics in `metrics/`. `/agent-readiness` scores the **subject
> repository's** readiness for AI-assisted development from a static checkout.
> Different subject, different input, different output. The inward-facing
> companion here is `/session-review`, whose `session-digest.jsonl` this command
> consumes (Step 1).

## Orchestrator constraints

1. **Do not modify agents or configuration.** Produce a report only. All remediation requires human action.
2. **Write the report to a file.** Present only the summary table and next-steps in chat — do not repeat the full report.
3. **Be concise.** Use tables and short sentences. No preambles, no filler.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

- `--output <path>`: Write report to a specific path. Default: `.dev-team-reports/harness-audit-<date>.md`
- `--pdf`: After writing the report, render it to a sibling PDF via `hooks/lib/report_pdf.py`, resolving against the **actual** report path written this run (the `--output` override when given, else the default). See `knowledge/report-pdf-integration.md`. Additive; non-fatal if no engine is available.

## Steps

### 1. Check for metrics data

Read metrics JSONL files from `metrics/`. Full field reference for every
stream below: `skill://dev-team-knowledge/telemetry-schema.md` — read it
instead of re-deriving a schema from the emitter. Five complementary streams
exist:

- `metrics/*-task-log.jsonl` — **self-reported** task logs (whatever the model
  chose to record about itself).
- `metrics/session-digest.jsonl` — **ground-truth** real-session digests from
  `/session-review` (#129): token/cost trends, `rework`/`accuracy` counts, and
  `utilization.never_observed_*`. Prefer this where it disagrees with the
  self-reports, and use `never_observed_*` to corroborate stale-component
  flags. Schema + join: see `docs/eval-system.md` → "Session-review trend
  digest".
- `~/.claude/metrics/artifact-usage.json` — **per-artifact usage index** written by the
  telemetry hook on each Skill invocation. Use `last_used_at` to identify
  artifacts that have never been observed (absent from the index) or are stale
  (absent or `last_used_at` > 30 days ago). Cross-reference with
  `never_observed_*` in `session-digest.jsonl` for corroboration. See
  `knowledge/artifact-lifecycle.md` for the lifecycle threshold definitions.
- `metrics/boundary-events.jsonl` — **boundary-level (policy-gateway) events**
  (#859): every guard hook's `block`/`warn`/`bypass` decision plus
  `intervention` keywords, each with the emitting `hook` and a `matched_rule`
  rule ID. Where `session-digest.jsonl`'s `rework` counts show outcomes
  without causes, join on `session_id` (when present on both streams) to
  attribute friction to a specific hook/rule instead of reasoning from counts
  alone.
- `metrics/eval-ablation.jsonl` — **causal** per-agent ablation evidence from
  `/agent-eval --ablation <agent>` (#868): a controlled baseline-vs-ablated
  integration-tier delta, not accumulated usage data. When a record exists
  for a drop-candidate agent, Step 3 cites its measured delta/verdict instead
  of relying on `review-value.jsonl` alone.

If no metrics data exists or insufficient data is available (fewer than 10 review runs logged), report:

> "Insufficient metrics data for a meaningful audit. Run the system for a period to accumulate review data, then re-run `/harness-audit`. Minimum: 10 logged review runs."

List what data is missing and exit.

### 2. Check for a stale baseline (re-baseline detection, #860)

Report-only — this step never edits `evals/baseline.json` or re-runs evals
itself; it only decides whether the report needs a **Re-baseline Required**
section.

1. Read `evals/baseline.json`. If the file is absent, skip this step
   entirely (nothing to compare).
2. Read its `model` field (written by `scripts/eval_variance.py
   --write-baseline --model <name>`, per the change-contract flow in
   `skills/feedback-learning/SKILL.md`). **Absent field = pre-migration
   baseline — do not prompt.** This is deliberate: a baseline recorded
   before the `model` field existed carries no false signal either way.
3. Read the current session's model from `metrics/session-digest.jsonl`
   (the most recent record's model field) or session metadata.
4. Compare. **On mismatch**, the report (Step 8) gains a **Re-baseline
   Required** section instructing the operator to re-run the eval suite and
   re-write the baseline (`/agent-eval` full suite + `eval_variance.py
   --write-baseline --model <current-model>`) before trusting any pre/post
   comparison elsewhere in this report or in a feedback-learning change
   contract. Flag explicitly that scaffolding kept alive by old-model scores
   (e.g. a removal candidate from Step 3 that "still fails" on the old
   model) may now be re-evaluable and possibly removable.
5. **On match** (or the field absent), no section is added — this is silent
   success, not a finding.

### 3. Analyze review agent effectiveness

For each review agent in the registry (`knowledge/agent-registry.md`):

1. **Finding rate**: How often does this agent produce findings (fail or warn) vs. pass?
2. **Zero-fail agents**: Flag agents that have never returned `fail` across all logged reviews. These are removal candidates — they may not be catching real issues.
3. **False positive rate**: If correction data exists (from `/apply-fixes`), check how often findings were dismissed vs. applied. Agents with >50% dismissed findings have a high false positive rate.
4. **Finding severity distribution**: Is the agent producing mostly minor findings? If >80% of findings are minor severity, consider whether the agent justifies its token cost. Compute this from the `severity_breakdown` object on `metrics/review-value.jsonl` rows (`{errors, warnings, suggestions}`, added in #1256) — aggregate per `agents_run` and treat `suggestions` as the minor bucket. Rows written before #1256 lack the field; count them as "no severity data" and exclude them from the ratio rather than assuming a mix (small-N honesty, consistent with Step 5). If **no** row carries `severity_breakdown`, report this analysis as dark ("severity breakdown unavailable — pre-#1256 metrics") rather than fabricating a distribution.

   ```bash
   log=".claude/metrics/review-value.jsonl"; [ -f "$log" ] || log="metrics/review-value.jsonl"
   [ -f "$log" ] && jq -s '
     map(select(.severity_breakdown != null))
     | group_by(.agents_run | sort | join(","))
     | map({
         agents:      (.[0].agents_run | sort | join(", ")),
         errors:      (map(.severity_breakdown.errors)      | add // 0),
         warnings:    (map(.severity_breakdown.warnings)    | add // 0),
         suggestions: (map(.severity_breakdown.suggestions) | add // 0)
       })
     | map(. + {total: (.errors + .warnings + .suggestions)})
     | map(select(.total > 0) | . + {minor_pct: (.suggestions / .total * 100 | round)})' \
     "$log"
   ```

### 4. Analyze review-value fix rates

Read `metrics/review-value.jsonl` (written by `/build` per #348, schema in `performance-metrics`). If the file is absent, note it and continue — this section is skippable.

For each **checkpoint type** (the `checkpoint` field: `step` or `slice`) and each **agent combination** (`agents_run` list, treated as a set-key), compute:

**Exclude read-only rows first (#1257).** Fix-rate ROI is only meaningful for
fix-applying `/build` checkpoints. A read-only review (`source: "code-review"`)
never applies fixes, so **every** row it produces has `issues_fixed: 0` and a 0%
fix rate — feeding those to the drop-candidate logic falsely flags a whole panel
that may be surfacing real defects (the 2026-07-20 run mislabeled all 7 agents
this way). The `jq` filters to `source == "build-checkpoint"` (treating an absent
`source` as `build-checkpoint`, back-compat) **before** grouping:

```bash
log=".claude/metrics/review-value.jsonl"; [ -f "$log" ] || log="metrics/review-value.jsonl"
[ -f "$log" ] && jq -s '
  map(select((.source // "build-checkpoint") == "build-checkpoint"))
  | group_by(.checkpoint + "|" + (.agents_run | sort | join(",")))
  | map({
      checkpoint:    .[0].checkpoint,
      agents:        (.[0].agents_run | sort | join(", ")),
      total:         length,
      no_op:         (map(select(.outcome=="no-op"))    | length),
      fixed:         (map(select(.outcome=="fixed"))     | length),
      escalated:     (map(select(.outcome=="escalated")) | length),
      fix_rate:      ((map(select(.outcome=="fixed")) | length) / length * 100 | round),
      issues_found:  (map(.issues_found)  | add // 0),
      issues_fixed:  (map(.issues_fixed)  | add // 0),
      fix_iterations:(map(.fix_iterations)| add // 0)
    })' \
  "$log"
```

For **read-only `code-review` rows**, report **finding-rate** (how often the
panel surfaced any issue) instead of fix-rate, and state plainly in the report
that these rows are excluded from the fix-rate drop-candidate logic because they
apply no fixes by design — a 0% fix rate there is expected, not a signal:

```bash
log=".claude/metrics/review-value.jsonl"; [ -f "$log" ] || log="metrics/review-value.jsonl"
[ -f "$log" ] && jq -s '
  map(select(.source == "code-review"))
  | if length == 0 then "no read-only rows" else
    group_by(.agents_run | sort | join(","))
    | map({
        agents:       (.[0].agents_run | sort | join(", ")),
        total:        length,
        found_issues: (map(select(.issues_found > 0)) | length),
        finding_rate: ((map(select(.issues_found > 0)) | length) / length * 100 | round)
      })
    end' \
  "$log"
```

Flag **drop candidates**: any checkpoint+agents combination (from the
fix-applying rows only) with `fix_rate == 0` across **N ≥ 5** logged runs is a
drop candidate — it consistently adds overhead without catching defects.

Flag **high-value checkpoints**: `fix_rate ≥ 50%` — these are earning their cost and should be retained.

**Drop-candidate recommendations** (P2-S3):
For each drop candidate emit a recommendation in this form:
> `<checkpoint>/<agents>` fixed 0/<N> runs (fix rate 0%) — candidate to drop. To act: remove this checkpoint type from the relevant `/build` step-complexity tier or exclude these agents from the checkpoint's dispatch list. Do not auto-edit skills; present for human decision.

**Cite ablation evidence when available (#868).** `review-value.jsonl` alone is
observational — a zero fix-rate agent might have been shielded by another
agent, dispatched against the wrong changesets, or never given a defect to
catch. Before finalizing each per-agent drop-candidate recommendation, check
for causal evidence:

```bash
for agent in <each single-agent drop candidate>; do
  python3 scripts/eval_ablation.py --find-latest "$agent" \
    --jsonl metrics/eval-ablation.jsonl
done
```

- **Record found** — cite it in the recommendation instead of (or alongside)
  the fix-rate line: `<agent> — ablation run <recorded_at> (model
  <model>): delta {issues_caught: <n>, test_commands_passed: <n>, tokens:
  <n>}, verdict "<verdict>". <If verdict is "baseline failed —
  inconclusive": state the evidence is unusable and the fix-rate signal
  above is the only basis for this recommendation.>`
- **No record found** — state the evidence is correlational-only and name
  the exact command that would upgrade it: `No ablation evidence for
  <agent> — this recommendation is based on correlational usage data only.
  Run \`/agent-eval --ablation <agent>\` to get a controlled baseline-vs-
  ablated delta before acting.`

This applies only to drop candidates that resolve to a **single** review
agent (multi-agent checkpoint combinations have no single-agent ablation
record to cite — note that explicitly rather than guessing which member
agent a record might apply to).

Do not modify any skill or agent file. The report is the only artifact.

### 5. Lesson Validation — validated-outcome weighting (#866)

Close the loop on `/feedback-learning` lessons: does an adopted lesson
measurably help, or should it become a rollback candidate? This step is
**report-only**, consistent with the orchestrator constraints above — it
never edits an agent, skill, or CLAUDE.md file, and a `harmful` verdict is
always a *proposal*, never an automatic rollback.

Reads `metrics/config-changelog.jsonl` (written by `/feedback-learning`,
schema in [feedback-learning](../feedback-learning/SKILL.md) → Audit Trail)
and `metrics/session-digest.jsonl` (this command's existing Step 1 input).
Both are metrics-only — no prompt or code content, consistent with the
session-review privacy boundary.

Run the deterministic helper (pure stdlib, zero model tokens for the
computation):

```bash
changelog=".claude/metrics/config-changelog.jsonl"; [ -f "$changelog" ] || changelog="metrics/config-changelog.jsonl"
python3 $DEV_TEAM_ROOT/skills/harness-audit/scripts/lesson_validate.py \
  --changelog "$changelog" \
  --digest metrics/session-digest.jsonl \
  --apply -o memory/lesson-validation.json
```

- **`--apply`** appends new `type: "validation"` entries to
  `metrics/config-changelog.jsonl` for every newly-judged lesson — this is an
  **append-only** write (new lines only); it never rewrites or deletes an
  existing line. Verify this yourself if in doubt: a byte-for-byte diff of the
  file before and after the run must show only appended lines.
- Every **adopted lesson with structured evidence** (`amend`/`learn`/`remember`
  entries whose `evidence` field is an object, not the literal string
  `"unmeasurable"` and not absent) whose observation window has elapsed gets a
  verdict:
  - **validated** — the watched metric moved in the expected `direction`.
  - **neutral** — the window elapsed, adequate data exists, no meaningful
    movement either way.
  - **harmful** — the watched metric moved against the expected `direction`.
  - **insufficient data** — fewer than `window_sessions` digest records exist
    on either side of adoption. This is a data condition, **never** reported
    as `neutral` — small-N honesty over a false-precision judgment.
  - Comparison is **direction-only** on window means (v1 — no significance
    testing; the digest carries small-N aggregate counts where formal testing
    would be false precision).
- Entries marked `"unmeasurable"` and **legacy** entries (written before the
  `evidence` field existed, so the key is absent) are **surfaced as counts
  only** — they never receive a verdict and are never proposed for rollback
  on evidence grounds.
- Each **harmful** verdict emits a **rollback proposal** carrying the
  original entry's `timestamp`, `file_modified`, `section_modified`, and
  `previous_value` — enough for `/feedback-learning`'s existing
  [Rollback](../feedback-learning/SKILL.md#rollback) flow to act on it after
  a human approves. Never auto-apply.

Include a **Lesson Validation** section in the report (Step 8) summarizing
verdict counts, the unmeasurable/legacy counts, and the full list of rollback
proposals.

### 6. Analyze model routing

For each agent listed in `knowledge/agent-registry.md` (with model tier from its `model:` frontmatter, resolved via the PreToolUse hook per `agents/orchestrator.md` → Resolution Procedure):

1. **Over-tiered agents**: Agents assigned to opus that consistently produce simple pattern-match findings may work equally well on sonnet or haiku.
2. **Under-tiered agents**: Agents on haiku that frequently miss issues caught by human review may need a higher tier.
3. **Cost distribution**: Which agents consume the most tokens? Are the most expensive agents also the most valuable?

### 7. Analyze orchestration complexity

Review the current pipeline for components that may be unnecessary overhead:

1. **Phase count**: Are all three phases (Research, Plan, Implement) needed for the types of tasks being run? If most tasks are simple, suggest a fast path.
2. **Review checkpoint frequency**: Are inline reviews running on every step? If most steps are trivial, the complexity classification (see `skills/plan/SKILL.md` § Complexity Classification) should be catching this.
3. **Unused skills**: Skills loaded but never applied in logged sessions.

### 8. Produce report

When `--pdf` was passed, after writing the report render **the actual output
path** (the `--output` override when given, else `.dev-team-reports/harness-audit-<date>.md`)
to a sibling PDF per `knowledge/report-pdf-integration.md` (additive; non-fatal
if no engine):

```bash
sh "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/py.sh" "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/lib/report_pdf.py" <the-output-path>
```

Write the report to the output path using this structure:

```markdown
# Harness Audit Report

**Date**: <date>
**Metrics period**: <earliest to latest logged review>
**Review runs analyzed**: <count>

## Re-baseline Required

> Only present when Step 2 detects a model mismatch between
> `evals/baseline.json`'s `model` field and the current session's model.
> Omit this section entirely on a match or an absent/pre-migration field.

- **Baseline model**: <model recorded in evals/baseline.json>
- **Current session model**: <current model>
- **Action**: Re-run the eval suite and re-write the baseline
  (`/agent-eval` full suite, then `eval_variance.py --write-baseline
  --model <current-model>`) before trusting any pre/post comparison in this
  report or in a feedback-learning change contract.
- **Possibly stale scaffolding**: <any removal candidate below whose
  "zero fail" or "high false positive" verdict was measured on the old
  model — flag for re-evaluation, not automatic removal>

## Review Agent Effectiveness

### Removal Candidates (zero fail findings)
| Agent | Reviews | Pass rate | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------------|

### High False Positive Rate (>50% dismissed)
| Agent | Findings | Dismissed | Rate | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|-----------|------|----------------|

### Low-Value Agents (>80% minor severity)
| Agent | Findings | Minor % | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|---------|----------------|

## Review-Value Fix Rates (inline checkpoint ROI)

> Source: `metrics/review-value.jsonl`. Absent = no `/build` runs logged yet.

### Per-Checkpoint-Type Fix Rates
| Checkpoint | Agents | Runs | No-op | Fixed | Escalated | Fix rate |
|------------|--------|------|-------|-------|-----------|----------|

### Drop Candidates (fix rate 0%, N ≥ 5 runs)
| Checkpoint | Agents | Runs | Ablation evidence | Recommendation |
|------------|--------|------|--------------------|-----------------|

> To act on a drop candidate: remove the checkpoint type from the relevant `/build`
> step-complexity tier or exclude the agents from that checkpoint's dispatch list.
> Requires human decision — do not auto-edit skills.
>
> "Ablation evidence" column: the cited `metrics/eval-ablation.jsonl` verdict +
> date for single-agent candidates, or "correlational only — run
> `/agent-eval --ablation <agent>`" when no record exists.

### High-Value Checkpoints (fix rate ≥ 50%)
| Checkpoint | Agents | Runs | Fix rate | Issues fixed |
|------------|--------|------|----------|--------------|

## Lesson Validation (validated-outcome weighting, #866)

> Source: `metrics/config-changelog.jsonl` × `metrics/session-digest.jsonl`.
> Report-only — verdicts are appended as new `type: "validation"` entries;
> harmful verdicts are rollback *proposals*, never automatic.

### Verdicts
| Lesson (`timestamp`) | Metric | Direction | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|

### Rollback Proposals (harmful verdicts — human approval required)
| Lesson (`timestamp`) | File | Section | Recommendation |
