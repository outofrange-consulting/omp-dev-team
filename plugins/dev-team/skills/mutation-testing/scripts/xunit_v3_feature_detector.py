"""Detect xunit.v3-only constructs that break the v2 mutation-shim compile,
and classify each so a human can decide how to handle it (#1160, part of #1156).

The v2 shim is the only path that gives the mutant-kill loop per-test coverage
on an xunit.v3 suite (validated in #669). Its weakness is compile fragility:
any xunit-v3-only API breaks the shim's compile before Stryker runs a mutant.
This module turns that opaque C# compile error into a classified list the
mutation-kill agent presents at an **always-ask, never-auto-drop** human gate.

Two classification axes:

- ``compile_ability`` — ``clean-translatable`` (a mechanical v2 equivalent
  exists) or ``no-v2-equivalent`` (the construct cannot compile under v2).
- ``coverage_impact`` — ``neutral`` (excluding the test from the shim changes
  no coverage, e.g. ``[Fact(Explicit = true)]`` tests are skipped by default)
  or ``bearing`` (the test runs and covers code, so excluding it inflates the
  loop's survivor set — the operator must be told which lines go dark).

Pure and stdlib-only. The interactive gate and the actual shim-exclusion wiring
(#1159) consume this module's structured output; this module never edits a file.
