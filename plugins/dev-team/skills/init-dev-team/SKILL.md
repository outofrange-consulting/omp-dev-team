# Init Dev Team

Role: worker. Installs tools required by the dev-team plugin, with a
focus on the mutation gate. Run after the plugin is installed, or when the
mutation gate reports a missing dependency.

Arguments: none — interactive prompts drive selection.

You have been invoked with the `/init-dev-team` command.

## Worker constraints

1. Install prerequisites and write config only where the user confirms.
2. Be OS-aware; do not assume a package manager.
3. **Be concise.** Report what was installed/skipped, no narration.

## Step 1 — Detect OS

Run the following and record the result:

```bash
uname -s
```

- `Darwin` → macOS (use `brew`)
- `Linux` → Linux (detect package manager below)
- `MINGW*` or `MSYS*` (e.g. `MINGW64_NT-10.0-22621`) → Windows running Git Bash
  (detect Windows package manager below)
- Other → note the platform; provide manual instructions and continue

> **Windows note:** Oh-My-Pi (OMP) on Windows runs in Git Bash (MINGW) or WSL.
> WSL reports `Linux` and is fully handled by the Linux steps. The Windows
> steps below apply to native Git Bash only. If you are using WSL, follow
> the Linux steps instead.

For Linux, detect the available package manager:

```bash
command -v apt-get && echo apt
command -v dnf     && echo dnf
command -v yum     && echo yum
command -v pacman  && echo pacman
```

Use the first one found.

For Windows (Git Bash), detect the available package manager:

```bash
command -v winget && echo winget
command -v choco  && echo choco
command -v scoop  && echo scoop
```

Use the first one found. If none are found, tell the user:
"No Windows package manager detected. Install winget (built into Windows 10/11
via the App Installer), Chocolatey (<https://chocolatey.org>), or Scoop
(<https://scoop.sh>), then re-run `/init-dev-team`."

## Step 2 — Install hard dependencies (jq and python3)

These are required by the mutation gate regardless of language.

### jq

Check if already installed:

```bash
command -v jq && jq --version
```

If missing, install:

| OS | Command |
|----|---------|
| macOS | `brew install jq` |
| Linux (apt) | `sudo apt-get install -y jq` |
| Linux (dnf/yum) | `sudo dnf install -y jq` or `sudo yum install -y jq` |
| Linux (pacman) | `sudo pacman -S --noconfirm jq` |
| Windows (winget) | `winget install jqlang.jq` |
| Windows (choco) | `choco install jq` |
| Windows (scoop) | `scoop install jq` |
| Unknown | Tell the user: "Install jq manually from <https://jqlang.github.io/jq/> and re-run `/init-dev-team`." |

### python3

Check if already installed:

```bash
command -v python3 && python3 --version
```

If missing, install:

| OS | Command |
|----|---------|
| macOS | `brew install python3` |
| Linux (apt) | `sudo apt-get install -y python3` |
| Linux (dnf/yum) | `sudo dnf install -y python3` or `sudo yum install -y python3` |
| Linux (pacman) | `sudo pacman -S --noconfirm python` |
| Windows (winget) | `winget install Python.Python.3` |
| Windows (choco) | `choco install python` |
| Windows (scoop) | `scoop install python` |
| Unknown | Tell the user: "Install Python 3 manually from <https://python.org> and re-run `/init-dev-team`." |

> **Windows python3 alias:** Windows installers often register the binary as
> `python`, not `python3`. After installing, check:
>
> ```bash
> command -v python3 || python --version
> ```
>
> If only `python` is found, create a Git Bash alias so the mutation gate can
> find it:
>
> ```bash
> echo "alias python3='python'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
> ```
>
> Verify with `python3 --version` before proceeding.

If either installation fails, stop and tell the user: "Could not install
`<tool>`. Please install it manually and re-run `/init-dev-team`."

## Step 2.5 — C# symbolic navigation (`omnisharp`, optional)

C# navigation and refactoring go through OMP's **native `lsp` tool**. OMP ships a
default server entry for `.cs`/`.csx` — command `omnisharp`, root markers
`*.sln` / `*.csproj` / `omnisharp.json` / `.git` — so the only thing missing is
the binary on `PATH`. There is no MCP server to wire and no repo onboarding step.

Skip this section entirely if the user selected no C# work.

**Check:**

```bash
command -v omnisharp && echo "omnisharp: present" || echo "omnisharp: MISSING"
```

If missing, tell the user: "C# language-server features (`lsp`) need `omnisharp`
on PATH — install the OmniSharp-Roslyn release for your platform from
<https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases>, or the equivalent
package for your distro." Then continue; it is optional, not a hard dependency.

Once present, `lsp` covers `definition`, `references`, `hover`, `symbols`,
`type_definition`, `implementation`, `rename`, `rename_file`, `code_actions` and
`diagnostics`, applying real `WorkspaceEdit`s. Whole-file `.cs` reads are already
curbed by `read.summarize.enabled` (default `true`).

> This step used to offer to onboard the repo with **Serena**, a Roslyn-backed
> MCP server, gated on `uvx` plus .NET 10, recording the answer in a
> harness-owned init-state file. All of it is gone: the Serena skills, the
> `serena-enforce` extension with its blanket deny on native `.cs` writes, and
> that state file. The deny was an unconditional block on every native `.cs`
> write in every repo, resting on an external MCP dependency — the opposite of
> the use-the-platform posture, once the platform grew an equivalent.
> `serena-build-net` stays: blocking session end on a red `dotnet build` has no
> native equivalent.

For a language OMP has no default server for, add it under `lsp` in
`~/.omp/agent/config.yml` rather than adding an MCP server here.

## Step 3 — Select languages

Ask the user which language ecosystems they are working with. Allow multiple
selections:

> "Which languages do you need mutation testing for? (Select all that apply)"
>
> 1. **JS/TS** — Stryker (`@stryker-mutator/core`)
> 2. **Java / Kotlin** — pitest (`pitest-maven` or `info.solidsoft.gradle.pitest`)
> 3. **C# / .NET** — Stryker.NET (`dotnet-stryker`)
> 4. **All of the above**
> 5. **None — just install jq and python3**

Parse the user's response. If they choose 4, treat it as selecting 1, 2, and 3.

## Step 4 — Install per-language mutation tools

Run only the sections for the languages the user selected.

### JS/TS — Stryker

**Prerequisites check:**

```bash
command -v node && node --version
command -v npm  && npm --version
```

If `node` or `npm` is not found, tell the user:
"Node.js is required for Stryker. Install it from <https://nodejs.org> and
re-run `/init-dev-team`." Do not proceed with this language section.

**Bootstrap project if package.json is missing:**

```bash
test -f package.json && echo "package.json found" || echo "no-package"
```

If the result is `no-package`:

1. Print: `No package.json found. Running /skill:js-project-init first to scaffold the project.`
2. Invoke the `/skill:js-project-init` skill — that is the form OMP uses for a
   skill that is not also registered as a command; the Claude-Code
   `/<plugin>:<skill>` namespace form is not supported and would simply not
   resolve. It will scaffold a
   functional ES-module project with prettier, eslint, editorconfig, and
   vitest (see the skill's own documentation for the full default set).
3. After the skill returns:
   - If `package.json` now exists → proceed to "Check if already installed".
   - If `package.json` still does not exist (user aborted js-project-init):
     print `Stryker skipped — no package.json. Re-run /init-dev-team after scaffolding your JS project.`
     and skip the rest of the JS/TS section.
   - If the skill reported an explicit failure: print
     `Stryker skipped — js-project-init failed. See errors above and re-run /init-dev-team after resolving them.`
     and skip the rest of the JS/TS section.

If the result is `package.json found`, proceed directly to "Check if already installed".

**Check if already installed (project-local):**

```bash
test -f node_modules/.bin/stryker && echo "installed" || echo "not found"
```

**If not installed, add Stryker as a dev dependency:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/core
```

Then detect the test runner and install the matching Stryker plugin:

```bash
# Check package.json for test runner hints
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"vitest"|"jest"|"mocha"|"jasmine"' | head -5
```

Install the appropriate runner plugin:

| Detected runner | Install command |
|-----------------|----------------|
| vitest | `npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/vitest-runner` |
| jest | `npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/jest-runner` |
| mocha | `npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/mocha-runner` |
| jasmine | `npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/jasmine-runner` |
| none detected | Install vitest runner as default: `npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/vitest-runner` and note to the user they may need to swap this for their runner |

**Initialize Stryker config if not already present:**

```bash
test -f stryker.config.js -o -f stryker.config.mjs -o -f stryker.config.ts \
  -o -f stryker.config.cjs -o -f .strykerrc.json && echo "config exists" || echo "no config"
```

If no config exists, run:

```bash
npx stryker init
```

This generates a `stryker.config.mjs` interactively. Tell the user it will ask
a few questions; they should accept defaults unless they have a specific setup.

**Verify:**

```bash
npx stryker --version
```

---

### Java / Kotlin — pitest

**Prerequisites check:**

```bash
command -v mvn   && echo "maven found"
command -v gradle && echo "gradle found"
```

If neither is found, tell the user:
"Maven or Gradle is required for pitest. Install one from
<https://maven.apache.org> or <https://gradle.org> and re-run `/init-dev-team`."

**Detect build tool:**

```bash
test -f pom.xml      && echo "maven"
test -f build.gradle -o -f build.gradle.kts && echo "gradle"
```

**Maven — check if pitest-maven already configured:**

```bash
grep -q 'pitest-maven' pom.xml 2>/dev/null && echo "configured" || echo "not configured"
```

If not configured, add the pitest-maven plugin to `pom.xml`. Find the
`<build><plugins>` section and insert:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.pitest</groupId>
  <artifactId>pitest-maven</artifactId>
  <version>1.17.4</version>
  <configuration>
    <outputFormats>
      <param>XML</param>
    </outputFormats>
    <timestampedReports>false</timestampedReports>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

Tell the user: "Added pitest-maven plugin to `pom.xml`. Run
`mvn pitest:mutationCoverage` to verify."

**Gradle — check if pitest plugin already applied:**

```bash
grep -q 'pitest' build.gradle 2>/dev/null || grep -q 'pitest' build.gradle.kts 2>/dev/null \
  && echo "configured" || echo "not configured"
```

If not configured, tell the user to add the following to `build.gradle` or
`build.gradle.kts` manually (Gradle plugins cannot be added programmatically):

For `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'info.solidsoft.pitest' version '1.15.0'
}

pitest {
    outputFormats = ['XML']
    timestampedReports = false
}
```

For `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("info.solidsoft.pitest") version "1.15.0"
}

configure<com.info.solidsoft.pitest.PitestPluginExtension> {
    outputFormats.set(setOf("XML"))
    timestampedReports.set(false)
}
```

**Verify (Maven only — Gradle requires manual add):**

```bash
mvn pitest:mutationCoverage -DtimestampedReports=false -DoutputFormats=XML --help 2>&1 | head -5
```

---

### C# / .NET — Stryker.NET

**Prerequisites check:**

```bash
command -v dotnet && dotnet --version
```

If `dotnet` is not found, tell the user:
".NET SDK is required for Stryker.NET. Install it from <https://dotnet.microsoft.com>
and re-run `/init-dev-team`."

**Check if dotnet-stryker already installed:**

```bash
dotnet tool list --global 2>/dev/null | grep stryker
dotnet tool list --local  2>/dev/null | grep stryker
```

**If not installed globally or locally, install as a local tool:**

Create or update `.config/dotnet-tools.json`:

```bash
# If the file doesn't exist, create the tool manifest
test -f .config/dotnet-tools.json || dotnet new tool-manifest

# Install dotnet-stryker as a local tool
dotnet tool install dotnet-stryker
```

If the user prefers global install (e.g., using Stryker across many projects),
offer:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-stryker
```

**Verify:**

```bash
dotnet stryker --version 2>/dev/null || dotnet tool run dotnet-stryker --version
```

---

## Step 4.5 — Check the model roles resolve

No probe, and nothing to write. OMP resolves an agent's `model:` frontmatter
through `modelRoles` in `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`; every dev-team agent declares
a CSV of role patterns whose last element is `@default`, so an unresolvable role
is skipped rather than fatal.

Verify and, if needed, fix:

```bash
omp models          # what the configured providers actually expose
```

- `/model` (or `omp models`) lists the resolved catalog. If a role you rely on
  (`@smol`, `@plan`, `@slow`, `@designer`, `@vision`) resolves to nothing, the
  agents that declare it silently fall through to the next pattern in their CSV.
- The fix is config, not a probe: paste this plugin's `config.snippet.yml` into
  `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` and adjust the ids to models your provider serves.
  Set `plan` and `task` **explicitly** — neither inherits a default, so leaving
  them unset makes those agents follow the parent session model instead of a
  declared tier.
- Per-agent overrides without editing any agent file: `task.agentModelOverrides`,
  `task.disabledAgents`, or the `/agents` picker.

This replaces a Claude-Code-era probe that GET-ed one vendor's `/v1/models` and
wrote a harness-owned model-overrides file. Both the script and that file are
absent from this repo, the endpoint was vendor-specific in a provider-open port,
and OMP's own resolver plus the per-agent fallback CSV make the probe redundant.

---

## Step 5 — Summary

Print a summary of what was installed:

```
dev-team: init complete

Hard dependencies:
  jq:       ✓ <version>
  python3:  ✓ <version>

Mutation testing:
  JS/TS  (Stryker):          ✓ <version>   [or: ✗ skipped | ✗ failed]
  Java   (pitest-maven):     ✓ configured  [or: ✗ skipped | ✗ manual steps needed]
  C#     (Stryker.NET):      ✓ <version>   [or: ✗ skipped | ✗ failed]

The mutation gate will now block zero-kill tests after each failing→passing transition.
Run a test suite to verify: when tests go from failing to passing, the gate
should analyze them within 60 seconds.
```

If any step failed, add a "Next steps" section with the specific manual actions
needed.
