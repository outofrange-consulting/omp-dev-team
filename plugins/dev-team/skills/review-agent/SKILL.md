# Review Agent

Role: worker. This skill performs the actual review using the agent
definition as its specification.

You have been invoked with the `/review-agent` skill. Run a single named review agent.

This command is executed under orchestrator direction. Pass the named
agent's tier alias (from its `model:` frontmatter) when dispatching —
the PreToolUse hook `hooks/agent-model-resolve.sh` resolves it to the
active snapshot per the Resolution Procedure in `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`.

## Worker constraints

1. **Follow the agent definition exactly.** The agent file is your
   specification — detect what it says to detect, skip what it says
   to skip.
2. **Respect context needs.** When reviewing uncommitted changes or `--since`,
   honor the agent's `Context needs` field (diff-only, full-file, or
   project-structure).
3. **Do not add findings beyond the agent's scope.** If the agent
   says "Ignore: naming, tests" — do not flag naming or test issues.
4. **Return structured JSON only.** Output the standard result
   format. Do not add prose commentary.
5. **Be concise.** Issue messages should be one sentence. Suggested
   fixes should be actionable, not explanatory. No preambles or
   filler.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Required: agent name (`$0`, e.g., `test-review`, `js-fp-review`, `security-review`)

Optional:

- `--since <ref>`: Review files changed since a git ref
- `--path <dir>`: Target directory (default: current working directory)

## Steps

### 1. Load agent definition

Read `.claude/agents/<name>.md`. If the file doesn't exist, list available
review agents from `.claude/agents/` (those declaring `Model tier:`) and
ask the user to pick one.

### 2. Determine target files

Same auto-scope logic as `/code-review`:

- If uncommitted changes exist: review those files
- If working tree is clean: review all source files
- `--since <ref>`: `git diff --name-only <ref>...HEAD`
- `--path <dir>`: review files in that directory

### 3. Run review

Follow the agent definition to review each target file. Produce a JSON result:

```json
{
  "agentName": "<name>",
  "status": "pass|warn|fail",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "error|warning|suggestion",
      "file": "<path>",
      "line": 0,
      "message": "<description>",
      "suggestedFix": "<fix>"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "<summary>"
}
```

### 3b. Apply ACCEPTED-RISKS.md suppression

Before reporting, consult `ACCEPTED-RISKS.md` at the repo root if present. For each issue, check rules in declaration order per `skill://dev-team-knowledge/accepted-risks-schema.md`. The first matching rule suppresses the issue from the displayed result and emits an audit entry of the form `SUPPRESSED: <file>:<line> [<rule_id>] by ACCEPTED-RISKS rule <rule.id>`. Expired rules become inert (stop suppressing). Schema-invalid rules fail the run with a specific parse error. Absent file: skip silently.

### 4. Report

Display the result as a formatted summary with issues grouped by file. Include suggested fixes inline. If any issues were suppressed by ACCEPTED-RISKS, list them in a dedicated trailing section with rule ids for audit.
