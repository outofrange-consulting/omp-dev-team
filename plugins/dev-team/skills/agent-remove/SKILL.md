# Agent Remove

Role: implementation. This skill removes an agent and all its references
from the system — it does not modify agent behavior or content.

You have been invoked with the `/agent-remove` skill. Fully remove a named
agent and update all required documentation.

## Implementation constraints

1. **Confirm before deleting.** Always show the user what will be removed
   and wait for confirmation before any destructive action.
2. **Detect agent type first.** Review agents (declare `Model tier:`) and
   team agents (declare persona sections) require different cleanup paths.
3. **Remove all references.** An agent that is deleted but still referenced
   in other files leaves the system in an inconsistent state.
4. **Always update documentation.** Documentation steps are mandatory.
   Invoke the tech-writer persona to review updated docs before reporting
   completion.
5. **Be concise.** Report only what changed. No narration of each step.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Required: agent name (`$0`) — the filename stem without `.md`
(e.g., `js-fp-review`, `security-engineer`)

Optional:

- `--dry`: Show what would be removed without making changes

## Steps

### 1. Locate agent file

Verify `.claude/agents/<name>.md` exists. If not, list all agent files
and report that the named agent was not found.

### 2. Detect agent type

Read `.claude/agents/<name>.md`:

- If it declares `Model tier:` → **review agent**
- Otherwise → **team agent**

### 3. Show removal plan

Display a confirmation prompt listing every action that will be taken:

```text
Remove agent: <name> (<type>)

Files to delete:
  - .claude/agents/<name>.md
  [review agents only]
  - .claude/evals/fixtures/<name>-* (if any)
  - .claude/evals/expected/<name>-* (if any)

Registry entries to remove:
  - .claude/CLAUDE.md: <table row>
  [team agents only]
  - docs/team-structure.md: <diagram node and edges>

Documentation to update:
  - docs/agent_info.md: remove table row
  [team agents only]
  - .claude/agents/orchestrator.md: Tier guidance bullet (if listed)
  - Other agent files referencing <name> in collaboration protocols

Proceed? (yes to continue)
```

If `--dry` was passed, display the plan and stop without waiting for
confirmation.

### 4. Remove agent file

```bash
git rm .claude/agents/<name>.md
```

If not in a git repository, use `rm`.

### 5. Clean up eval artifacts (review agents only)

Search for and remove matching eval fixtures and expected files:

```bash
ls .claude/evals/fixtures/ | grep <name>
ls .claude/evals/expected/ | grep <name>
```

Remove each matching file with `git rm` (or `rm` if not in git).

### 6. Update .claude/CLAUDE.md

- Remove the agent's row from the appropriate table (Team Agents or
  Review Agents)
- No routing-table edit required — tier-to-snapshot resolution flows
  through `skill://dev-team-knowledge/model-routing.json` and the PreToolUse hook;
  removing the agent file is sufficient
- Remove the agent from the Skills Registry if listed

### 7. Update .claude/agents/orchestrator.md (team agents only)

- Remove the agent name from the "Tier guidance (informational)"
  bullet list if it appears there (illustrative examples only; not a
  binding dispatch table)
- Remove from the Inline Review Checkpoint table (if listed as a
  triggered agent)

### 8. Update cross-references in other agent files

Search for references to the removed agent:

```bash
grep -r "<name>" .claude/agents/ --include="*.md" -l
```

For each file found, remove or update:

- Collaboration protocol entries that name the removed agent
- Skills section references (if a team agent was referenced as a skill)

### 9. Update docs/agent_info.md

- Remove the agent's row from the Team Agents or Review Agents table
- If removing a team agent, remove any "Primary Collaborators" references
  in prose sections

### 10. Update docs/team-structure.md (team agents only)

Remove the agent node and all its edges from both Mermaid diagrams.

Example: removing `SecE[Security Engineer]`:

- Remove the node declaration line
- Remove all edges involving `SecE` (`SecE <--> AR`, `SecE <--> QA`, etc.)

### 11. Tech-writer review

Invoke the tech-writer persona to review all modified documentation files
for accuracy and consistency before reporting completion. Specifically check:

- No dangling references to the removed agent remain in any doc
- Tables are consistent across CLAUDE.md and docs/
- Mermaid diagrams render correctly (no orphaned edges)

### 12. Report

```text
Agent removed: <name> (<type>)

Deleted:
  - .claude/agents/<name>.md
  [+ eval files if any]

Updated:
  - .claude/CLAUDE.md
  - docs/agent_info.md
  [+ orchestrator.md, team-structure.md, cross-references as applicable]

Tech-writer review: PASS

Documentation is consistent.
```
