# Headless Run

Role: worker. This skill runs one Claude Code prompt in a maximally isolated
subprocess and returns its JSON result — it does not review, plan, or edit.

## When to use it

Use it for **scripted, one-shot headless invocations** — above all a benchmark
harness that shells out to `claude -p` per case (the #821 harness that runs
`/code-review` once per fixture). A plain nested `claude -p` launched inside a
live Claude Code Remote session inherits the parent's identity and tool surface
(see `docs/using-plugin-skills-in-the-web-environment.md` and issue #842):

- **Reused `session_id`** — the nested run reports the *same* session id as the
  parent, so runs are not independent.
- **Remote-injected tool surface** — the nested run sees Remote-runtime MCP
  tools a local CLI session never exposes, changing the tool set under test.

This skill is the reusable workaround for that #842 constraint.

## Isolation guarantees

The helper builds each dispatch to leak as little parent state as possible:

- **Fresh session id.** A new `uuid.uuid4()` is passed as `--session-id <uuid>`,
  so the nested run cannot reuse the parent `session_id`. This is the key fix.
- **Clean HOME + config.** A throwaway temp `HOME` and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — no
  shared config, `.claude/memory/`, or telemetry state carries over.
- **Scrubbed env.** Inherited `CLAUDE_*` session/Remote identity vars (e.g.
  `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`) are removed, then `IS_SANDBOX=1` and
  `DEV_TEAM_TELEMETRY=off` are set fresh.
- **No resume.** The command never uses `--resume`/`-r` or `--fork-session`.
- **JSON result + timeout.** Runs with `--output-format json` and a hard
  subprocess timeout; prints the verified `session_id`, cost, and token usage.

## Auth vs. isolation (#957)

The fresh `HOME` also wipes Claude Code's login state, so a dispatch
reports "Not logged in" unless `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set. `~/.claude.json`
alone does **not** fix this — confirmed empirically, twice — something
under `~/.claude/` itself gates the login check ahead of Claude Code's
actual (Keychain-backed) OAuth token lookup. Pass `--preserve-auth` to
copy `~/.claude.json` and most of `~/.claude/` into the cell home first,
restoring login for operators who authenticate via `claude login` rather
than an API key. This is a real tradeoff, not free: it carries over
`settings.json`, `projects/`, `sessions/`, `mcpServers`, `plugins/`, and
other app state — `copy_auth_state()`'s `_CLAUDE_DIR_EXCLUDE` skips the
clearly bulky, clearly-not-auth-related pieces (`history.jsonl`,
`file-history/`, `session-env/`, `paste-cache/`, `shell-snapshots/`,
`debug/`, `telemetry/`, `downloads/`), but everything else rides along
since we don't have a confirmed narrower answer for exactly which piece
satisfies the login check. Off by default; the code-review-benchmark
harness (`runner.make_isolated_dispatch_fn()`) turns it on unconditionally,
since running that harness at all presupposes the operator's own
subscription.

It improves on the existing precedent in `scripts/run_tdd_experiment.py`
(`make_cell_home` / `cell_env` / `dispatch`), which does `env = dict(os.environ)`
and does **not** scrub identity vars.

## Honest upstream caveat

The `session_id` and **tool-surface** inheritance is an **upstream Claude Code /
Remote-runtime behavior — not fixable in this plugin repo**. This skill removes
env-carried identity and forces a fresh session id, but **Remote-injected MCP
tools are not env-carried and cannot be scrubbed here**. The fully-supported
path for a benchmark harness therefore stays a **plain local CLI checkout, not a
run nested inside a Remote session**. Use this skill to maximize isolation when a
local checkout is not available; treat its results as best-effort under that
caveat.

## How to invoke the helper

Run the shipped script, passing the prompt (a slash command works) and optional
`--cwd` / `--model` / `--timeout`:

```bash
python3 "$DEV_TEAM_ROOT/skills/headless-run/scripts/isolated_dispatch.py" \
  "/code-review" --cwd "$TARGET_REPO" --model sonnet --timeout 900 [--preserve-auth]
```

It prints one JSON object (`session_id`, `cost_usd`, token counts, `num_turns`,
`is_error`) and exits non-zero on error or timeout — parse that in the harness.
When running from files without the plugin loaded, substitute the in-repo path
`plugins/dev-team/skills/headless-run/scripts/isolated_dispatch.py`.

## Output

Report the printed JSON result (or the timeout/error line) and the fresh
`session_id` the dispatch used. Be concise — do not restate the script body.
