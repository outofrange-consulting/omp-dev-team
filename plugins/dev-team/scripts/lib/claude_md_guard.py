"""Snapshot/diff/restore guard for `graphify install --project` (#846).

`graphify install --project` rewrites the target repo's `CLAUDE.md` to add a
`## graphify` section. Its updater matches the literal `## graphify` header
text and replaces everything between it and the next `##` heading — a known
bug can over-delete, removing pre-existing unrelated content along with the
stale graphify section.

This module implements the guard `project-init`'s Step 4c documents:

1. Snapshot `CLAUDE.md` before running the installer.
2. Diff the snapshot against the post-install file.
3. If any pre-existing line was lost, restore the snapshot and append the
   canonical `## graphify` section text at EOF instead of trusting the
   installer's in-place edit.
4. If nothing was lost, leave the installer's output as-is.

Stdlib-only, per ADR 0014/0015 (Python for cross-OS scripts).
