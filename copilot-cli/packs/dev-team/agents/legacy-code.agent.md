# legacy-code — get code under test before changing it

Techniques for safely modifying code that lacks tests or has poor structure.
Legacy code is code without tests (Michael Feathers' definition) — regardless of
age. Get code under test before changing it, then improve structure
incrementally.

## Constraints

- Never change behavior and structure in the same step; refactor under green
  tests only.
- Write characterization tests before modifying legacy code — not after.
- Prefer the smallest dependency break that gets code under test.
- Do not apply aggressive refactoring without test coverage.

## Core Concepts

### Legacy Code Definition

Code without tests. A well-structured 6-month-old codebase with no tests is
legacy. A messy 10-year-old codebase with comprehensive tests is not. The
presence or absence of tests determines whether you can change code safely.

### The Legacy Code Change Algorithm

1. **Identify change points** — where does the change need to happen?
2. **Find test points** — where can you observe the effects of the change?
3. **Break dependencies** — make the code testable without changing its behavior.
4. **Write tests** — characterization tests that lock down existing behavior.
5. **Make changes and refactor** — now that tests protect you, modify behavior
   and improve structure.

### Seams

A seam is a place where behavior can be altered without editing the code under
test:

- **Object seams** — use polymorphism to substitute behavior (interfaces,
  subclasses).
- **Link seams** — substitute dependencies at the linking/import level (DI,
  module mocking).
- **Preprocessing seams** — alter behavior via build config, feature flags, or
  compile-time substitution.

### Characterization Tests

Tests that document what the code *actually does*, not what it *should do*. They
lock down existing behavior so you can detect unintended changes. They answer:
"If I make a change here, what breaks?"

## Patterns

### Characterization Test Procedure

1. Find the code area you need to change.
2. Write a test that calls the code and lets it fail to reveal actual output.
3. Update the test assertion to match observed behavior.
4. Repeat until the change area and its immediate dependencies are covered.
5. Use these tests as a safety net — any behavioral change now shows as a test
   failure.

### Dependency Breaking Techniques

| Technique | When to Use | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extract Interface | Class has many dependencies you need to substitute | Low |
| Extract Method | Long method with embedded logic you need to isolate | Low |
| Parameterize Constructor | Class creates its own dependencies internally | Low |
| Subclass and Override Method | Need to neutralize or replace specific behavior in tests | Medium |
| Wrap Method | Adding behavior before/after existing method without modifying it | Low |
| Wrap Class (Decorator) | Adding behavior transparently to callers of existing class | Medium |
| Sprout Method | New behavior is clearly separable from existing method | Low |
| Sprout Class | New behavior requires its own state or complex logic | Medium |
| Adapt Parameter | Method depends on a type you can't use in tests | Medium |

### Sprout vs. Wrap Decision

- **Sprout** (new method/class called from existing code): use when the new
  behavior is an addition that existing code needs to invoke at a specific point.
  The existing code changes minimally — it gains one call to the new method.
- **Wrap** (new code that calls existing code): use when existing callers must
  see the new behavior transparently without modification. The new code sits
  between callers and the original code.

### Strangler Pattern

Incrementally replace legacy components by routing new behavior through new code
while old code remains operational:

1. Identify a bounded area of legacy functionality.
2. Build new implementation alongside the old.
3. Route new requests/features through new code.
4. Gradually migrate existing behavior to new code.
5. Remove old code only when fully replaced and verified.

## Output

Report the legacy code analysis: identified change points, test points,
dependency breaks needed, characterization test targets, and the recommended
refactoring sequence. Be concise — bullet list format; skip background
explanation.

## When to Apply

| Situation | Apply? |
| --- | --- |
| Modifying code without tests | Yes |
| Adding behavior to poorly structured code | Yes |
| Migrating legacy components to new architecture | Yes |
| Greenfield development | No |
| Code already well-tested and well-structured | No |
| Pure deletion of unused code | No |

## Guidelines

1. Never change behavior and structure in the same step. Refactor under green
   tests only.
2. Write characterization tests before modifying legacy code. They document
   current behavior, not desired behavior.
3. Prefer the smallest dependency break that gets code under test. Aggressive
   refactoring without test coverage creates risk.
4. Sprout when the new behavior is clearly separable; wrap when existing callers
   must see the new behavior transparently.
5. Every dependency break is temporary scaffolding — revisit and clean up once
   test coverage allows broader refactoring.
6. If you cannot find a seam, extract method first. Extract Method is the safest
   starting point for almost any dependency break.
7. Characterization tests are not a substitute for acceptance tests. They lock
   behavior; acceptance tests define behavior.

## Integration

- **specs** — when modifying legacy code to add new behavior, specify the new
  behavior first, then use this skill to get existing code under test before
  implementing.
- **hexagonal-architecture** — dependency breaking techniques move legacy code
  toward port/adapter separation incrementally.
- **quality-gate-pipeline** — verify characterization tests match observed
  behavior; legacy changes have higher defect risk, apply review-correction with
  increased scrutiny.
- **mutation-testing** — after writing characterization tests, use mutation
  testing to verify those tests catch behavioral changes.
- **testability-patterns** — constructor injection, Test Data Builder, interface
  extraction, and the "I Can't Test This Class" decision flow complement the
  dependency-breaking techniques here:
  `~/.copilot/dev-team/knowledge/skills/dev-team-knowledge/testability-patterns.md`.
  Read it when the dependency break needed is a design change (extract interface,
  add constructor) rather than a seam insertion.
