# Output Format Reference

## Per-agent JSON result

```json
{
  "agentName": "structure-review",
  "status": "pass|warn|fail|skip",
  "modelTier": "mid",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "error|warning|suggestion",
      "confidence": "high|medium|none",
      "file": "src/auth/login.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "message": "God object: AuthController handles login, registration, and password reset",
      "suggestedFix": "Split into LoginController, RegistrationController, and PasswordResetController"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "2 issues found: 1 error, 1 warning"
}
```

### `confidence` field values

| Value | Meaning | `apply-fixes` behavior |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| `high` | Mechanical fix; correct with high certainty | Auto-apply |
| `medium` | Direction right; tradeoffs possible | Present as suggested diff — require confirmation |
| `none` | Requires human judgment | Present finding only; do not generate correction prompt |

## Aggregated JSON result (`--json` flag)

```json
{
  "overall": "pass|warn|fail",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-01T12:00:00Z",
  "targetFiles": 42,
  "preFlightPassed": true,
  "agents": [
    {"agentName": "test-review", "status": "pass", "modelTier": "mid", "issues": [], "summary": "..."}
  ],
  "totals": {"errors": 0, "warnings": 2, "suggestions": 1},
  "tokenEstimate": {
    "totalInputFiles": 15000,
    "agentCount": 11,
    "contextStrategy": "diff-only|full-file|mixed"
  },
  "summary": "WARN (N agents passed, N warned, N failed). N total issues."
}
```

The `tokenEstimate` field provides rough cost observability:

- `totalInputFiles`: approximate character count of all input files passed to agents
- `agentCount`: number of agents that ran (not skipped)
- `contextStrategy`: whether diff-only, full-file, or a mix was used

## Correction prompt JSON

```json
{
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "confidence": "high|medium",
  "category": "structure-review",
  "instruction": "Fix: God object handles too many concerns (Suggested: Split into focused controllers)",
  "context": "Line 42 in src/auth/login.ts",
  "affectedFiles": ["src/auth/login.ts"]
}
```

Severity mapping: error→high, warning→medium, suggestion→low.

Correction prompts are only generated for issues with `confidence: high` or `confidence: medium`. Issues with `confidence: none` are included in the review report but do not produce correction prompts — they require human judgment and must be resolved manually before merging.

## Status rules

- **pass**: Zero issues
- **warn**: Issues found, none are errors
- **fail**: At least one error-severity issue
- **skip**: Agent is inapplicable to the target (e.g., no JS/TS files for js-fp-review)

## Model tier values

Each agent declares a `Model tier` field that controls which model runs it:

| Tier | Model | Use for |
| ------ | ------- | --------- |
| `small` | Haiku | Pattern matching, thresholds, naming checks |
| `mid` | Sonnet | Structural analysis, test quality, mutation detection |
| `frontier` | Opus | Security analysis, domain modeling, semantic reasoning |

## Context needs values

Each agent declares a `Context needs` field that controls what input it receives:

| Value | Input | When to use |
| ------- | ------- | ------------- |
| `diff-only` | Git diff output only | Pattern-matching agents (naming, FP) |
| `full-file` | Complete file contents | Agents needing function-level context |
| `project-structure` | Full files + directory tree | Agents reasoning about architecture |

## Review Findings prompt (interactive — step 6)

When actionable issues exist, present this prompt before any fix action:

```text
## Review Findings

Found N actionable issues (N errors, N warnings) that can be
auto-fixed, plus N issues requiring human review.

Actionable issues by agent:
- structure-review: 3 (2 error, 1 warning)
- naming-review: 2 (2 warning)
- js-fp-review: 1 (1 error)

Options:
1. **Fix** — Auto-fix actionable issues and re-run review
   (up to 5 iterations until clean)
2. **Report only** — Save all findings to a report without
   modifying any code
```

## Review-Fix Loop iteration log (step 6a-iv)

```text
## Review-Fix Loop

| Iteration | Actionable Issues | Fixed | Remaining | Agents Re-run |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 1         | 7                 | 6     | 1         | 3             |
| 2         | 1                 | 1     | 0         | 1             |

Loop converged in 2 iterations.
```

If the loop did not converge:

```text
Loop stopped after 5 iterations. 2 issues remain:
- [security-review] SQL injection at src/db/query.ts:42 [auto-fix failed — human review required]
- [domain-review] Abstraction leak at src/api/handler.ts:15 [confidence: none — human review required]
```

## Code Review Summary report (step 7, prose mode)

```text
# Code Review Summary

| Agent              | Status | Issues | Fixed | Model Tier |
|--------------------|--------|--------|-------|------------|
| test-review        | PASS   | 0      | —     | mid        |
| structure-review   | PASS   | 2      | 2     | mid        |
| security-review    | WARN   | 1      | 0     | frontier   |
| ...                | ...    | ...    | ...   | ...        |

Overall: WARN after 2 fix iterations (N agents passed, N warned, N failed)
Total issues found: N | Auto-fixed: N | Human review required: N
```

After the summary, list remaining issues grouped by file, sorted by severity. Mark each with: `[confidence: none]`, `[auto-fix failed]`, or `[suggestion]`. Append the iteration table above.

## Override audit log entry (step 2, `--force` path)

Append to `metrics/override-audit.jsonl` (create if missing):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
  "branch": "<current branch>",
  "triggeredBy": "--force",
  "reason": "<value of --reason>",
  "targetFiles": ["<file list>"],
  "gatesSkipped": ["lint", "type-check", "secret-scan", "semgrep", "pipeline-red"]
}
```
