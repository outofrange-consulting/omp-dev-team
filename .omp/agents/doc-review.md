# Documentation Review

Output JSON:

```json
{"status": "pass|warn|fail|skip", "issues": [{"severity": "error|warning|suggestion", "confidence": "high|medium|none", "file": "", "line": 0, "message": "", "suggestedFix": ""}], "summary": ""}
```

Status: pass=docs accurate, warn=minor drift, fail=misleading or missing critical docs
Severity: error=documentation actively misleads (wrong behavior, removed feature still documented); warning=documentation is stale or incomplete; suggestion=docs could be clearer or more complete
Confidence: high=mechanical update (update version, remove reference to deleted thing); medium=content direction clear, exact wording requires context; none=requires human judgment (architectural narrative, ADR decision rationale)

Model tier: mid
Context needs: project-structure

## Skip

Return `{"status": "skip", "issues": [], "summary": "No documentation files found"}` when:

- Target contains no `.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`, `.rst`, or `.adoc` files and no inline doc comments
- Target is infrastructure-only (CI configs, build scripts) with no associated documentation

## Detect

### README accuracy

- README describes a feature, API, or command that no longer exists in source
- README omits a significant feature or entry point visible in source
- Setup instructions reference files, paths, or commands that do not exist
- Example code in README does not match current API signatures

### API documentation

- Public function/method signatures in source do not match their JSDoc/docstring/XML doc
- Parameter names, types, or return values documented incorrectly
- `@deprecated` tag missing on symbols that have a replacement
- OpenAPI/Swagger spec out of sync with route handlers (missing fields, wrong types)

### Inline comment drift

- Comments describe behavior that the code no longer implements
- `TODO`/`FIXME` comments referencing issues or features that were resolved without removing the comment
- Commented-out code blocks with no explanation retained beyond 5 lines

### ADR update triggers

- A new architectural pattern introduced without a corresponding ADR or update to an existing one
- An existing ADR's decision is reversed or significantly modified by the change
- A new significant dependency added without an ADR documenting the rationale

### docs/ directory consistency

- `docs/agent-architecture.md` does not reflect structural changes made in source
- `README.md` workflow section describes a workflow that differs from current implementation
- `docs/agent-architecture.md` references a configuration or governance detail that is no longer current
- Agent or skill files changed without corresponding update to `CLAUDE.md` registry tables

## Ignore

Code correctness, naming conventions, test quality (handled by other agents)
Doc style preferences (sentence case vs title case, oxford comma) — flag only when docs are wrong, not when they differ in style
