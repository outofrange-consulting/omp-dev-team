# Upgrade

Role: worker. This command updates the dev-team plugin to the latest version and ensures its marketplace is set to auto-update going forward.

Arguments: none.

You have been invoked with the `/upgrade` command.

## Worker constraints

1. Use the official plugin update mechanism; do not hand-edit installed plugin files.
2. Report available updates before applying.
3. **Be concise.** Report version deltas only.

## Steps

### 0. Detect and migrate legacy plugin ids

The plugins in the `bfinster` marketplace were renamed:

- `agentic-dev-team` → `dev-team`
- `agentic-security-assessment` → `security-assessment`

This step detects users still installed under the old ids and migrates
them. **Ordering matters**: install the new plugin FIRST, then uninstall
the old one only after the install succeeds. A failed install must leave
the user with the still-working old plugin and a clear retry command —
never with no plugin at all.

The migration logic lives at `evals/upgrade-migration/migrate.py`. Invoke
it directly so the embedded body and the file cannot drift; the eval
runner in the same directory exercises four fixtures (legacy dev-team,
legacy security-assessment, both legacy, already-migrated) plus an
install-first-then-uninstall ordering check.

```bash
python3 evals/upgrade-migration/migrate.py
```

Behavior:

- Reads `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (path overridable via
  the `UPGRADE_INSTALLED_JSON` env var for testability).
- For each plugin id matching a legacy name, derives the install scope
  from `claude plugin list` (default: `user`) and schedules:
  `claude plugin install --scope <scope> <new>@<marketplace>` then,
  ONLY on success, `claude plugin uninstall --scope <scope> <old>@<marketplace>`.
- On install failure: prints `MIGRATION FAILED — old plugin still
  installed.` plus the exact retry command and exits non-zero.
- On no legacy ids found: prints `No legacy plugin ids found` and falls
  through to Step 1.
- On successful migration: prints a summary block listing the old → new
  pairs, then an `ACTION REQUIRED` line telling the user to restart
  Oh-My-Pi (OMP) and re-run `/upgrade` for auto-update opt-in.

**If a migration occurred (exit zero with summary), STOP `/upgrade`
here.** `migrate.py` exits zero and prints the summary; `/upgrade` (the
command-layer flow) must treat that as a terminal condition and not
proceed to Step 1. Do NOT continue into Step 1 (Read current version)
or Step 2 (Auto-update status check) in the same invocation — Step 2's
Python block hard-codes `PLUGIN = "dev-team"` and would re-prompt about
auto-update against a plugin the user just installed seconds ago.
Restart-first, then they can opt into auto-update on the next run.

**If exit code is non-zero**, surface the migration failure to the user
verbatim and stop. Do not continue.

**If no legacy ids were found** (the steady-state case), continue to
Step 1.

**Sunset**: remove this Step 0 (and the `evals/upgrade-migration/`
directory) after both `dev-team` and `security-assessment` reach v2.0.0
or 2027-06-01, whichever comes first. The tracking note lives in
`docs/decisions/upgrade-step-0-sunset.md`.

### 1. Read current version

Read the installed plugin's `plugin.json` to get the current version:

```bash
claude plugin list
```

Parse the output to find `dev-team` and its current version. Also read the installed `plugin.json` directly:

```
~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/dev-team/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

Report:
> **Current version**: dev-team v{version} (installed from {marketplace})

### 2. Check auto-update status and ask the user

First, check the current auto-update status by running the script below and reporting it to the user.

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, os

PLUGIN = "dev-team"
home = os.path.expanduser("~")
cwd = os.getcwd()

def load(path):
    try:
        with open(path) as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return None
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"unknown ({path} is not valid JSON)")
        raise SystemExit(0)

installed = (load(os.path.join(home, ".claude", "plugins", "installed_plugins.json")) or {}).get("plugins", {})
market = next((pid.split("@", 1)[1] for pid in installed if pid.split("@", 1)[0] == PLUGIN and "@" in pid), None)
if not market:
    print("unknown (marketplace not found)")
    raise SystemExit(0)

candidates = [
    os.path.join(cwd, ".claude", "settings.json"),
    os.path.join(cwd, ".claude", "settings.local.json"),
    os.path.join(home, ".claude", "settings.json"),
]
for path in candidates:
    data = load(path)
    if data and market in (data.get("extraKnownMarketplaces") or {}):
        flag = data["extraKnownMarketplaces"][market].get("autoUpdate")
        print("enabled" if flag is True else "disabled")
        raise SystemExit(0)

print("disabled")
PY
```

Then ask the user:

> Auto-update for the `{marketplace}` marketplace is currently **{enabled/disabled}**.
> Would you like to enable auto-update so future releases install automatically? (yes/no)

Wait for the user's answer before continuing. If they say **yes**, run the enable block below. If they say **no**, skip to step 3.

**Enable block** (run only if the user consents):

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, os

PLUGIN = "dev-team"
home = os.path.expanduser("~")
cwd = os.getcwd()

def load(path):
    try:
        with open(path) as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return None
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"  ! {path} is not valid JSON ({e}); skipping")
        return None

installed = (load(os.path.join(home, ".claude", "plugins", "installed_plugins.json")) or {}).get("plugins", {})
market = next((pid.split("@", 1)[1] for pid in installed if pid.split("@", 1)[0] == PLUGIN and "@" in pid), None)
if not market:
    print(f"  ! Could not resolve the marketplace for '{PLUGIN}'; skipping.")
    raise SystemExit(0)

candidates = [
    os.path.join(cwd, ".claude", "settings.json"),
    os.path.join(cwd, ".claude", "settings.local.json"),
    os.path.join(home, ".claude", "settings.json"),
]
target = None
for path in candidates:
    data = load(path)
    if data and market in (data.get("extraKnownMarketplaces") or {}):
        target = [path, data]
        break

if target is None:
    reg = load(os.path.join(home, ".claude", "plugins", "known_marketplaces.json")) or {}
    entry = reg.get(market)
    if not entry:
        print(f"  ! Marketplace '{market}' not found in settings or registry; skipping.")
        raise SystemExit(0)
    path = os.path.join(home, ".claude", "settings.json")
    data = load(path) or {}
    data.setdefault("extraKnownMarketplaces", {})[market] = {"source": entry["source"]}
    target = [path, data]

path, data = target
mk = data["extraKnownMarketplaces"][market]
if mk.get("autoUpdate") is True:
    print(f"  auto-update already enabled for '{market}' ({path})")
else:
    mk["autoUpdate"] = True
    with open(path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
        f.write("\n")
    print(f"  enabled auto-update for '{market}' in {path}")
    print("  (takes effect on next Oh-My-Pi (OMP) launch / plugin operation)")
PY
```

Report the one-line result to the user, then continue to step 3.

### 3. Run the update

First, determine the install scope from `claude plugin list` output (the `Scope:` line for `dev-team`). It will be one of: `user`, `project`, `local`, `managed`.

```bash
claude plugin update --scope {scope} dev-team@{marketplace}
```

Where `{scope}` is the detected install scope (e.g., `project`) and `{marketplace}` is the marketplace name (e.g., `bfinster`). The `--scope` flag is required — the CLI defaults to `user`, which will fail if the plugin is installed at a different scope.

If the command succeeds with a version change, proceed to step 4.

If the output indicates already up to date:
> Already running the latest version (v{version}).

Exit.

If the command fails, report the error and suggest:
> Update failed. You can try a manual reinstall:
>
> ```
> claude plugin uninstall dev-team@{marketplace}
> claude plugin install dev-team@{marketplace}
> ```

Exit.

### 4. Confirm the update

Read the new `plugin.json` to verify the version changed:

```bash
claude plugin list
```

Report:

```
## Upgrade Complete

Previous: v{old_version}
Updated:  v{new_version}

Restart Oh-My-Pi (OMP) to apply the update.
```

## Notes

- The `claude plugin update` command handles fetching, caching, and version management
- Previous versions are kept for 7 days so active sessions continue working
- A restart of Oh-My-Pi (OMP) is required for the new version to take effect
- Step 2 checks the current auto-update status and asks the user before enabling it. The flag is `extraKnownMarketplaces.<marketplace>.autoUpdate: true` in `settings.json` (the same flag the `/plugin` UI toggles; there is no dedicated `claude plugin` CLI subcommand for it). With it on, routine releases land without running `/upgrade`.
