# Version

Role: worker. This command reports the installed plugin version.

You have been invoked with the `/version` command.

Arguments: none.

## Worker constraints

1. Read only; never write or modify files.
2. Report the first match found; do not aggregate.
3. **Be concise.** Output only the version line.

## Steps

Find the installed plugin version by checking these locations in order:

1. **Project-level install**: Look for a `plugin.json` under the current project's `.claude/plugins/` directory that contains `"name": "dev-team"`. Use `find` or `Glob` to locate it.
2. **User-level cache**: List directories under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/bfinster/dev-team/` — each subdirectory name is a cached version. Report the highest version found.
3. **Marketplace source**: Read `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/bfinster/plugins/dev-team/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and extract the `version` field.

Report the **first match found** (project > cache > marketplace).

Output format: `dev-team@bfinster v{version} (source: {project|cache|marketplace})`
